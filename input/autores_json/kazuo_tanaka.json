        "abstract": "This paper presents an improved approach to servo control for nonlinear systems with constraints on inputs and states using the fuzzy model-based control approach. In our previous paper, servo control based on error dynamics using error vector and input difference was proposed. Although the approach can achieve servo control with constraints on both of inputs and states, error dynamics with time-varying extra terms cannot be applied. In this paper, time-varying cancellation input is newly introduced. By using the cancellation input, servo control for error dynamics with time varying extra terms is achieved. We derive servo controller design conditions and constraint conditions on inputs and states in the form of LMI. Design examples illustrate the utility of this approach. ",

        "organization": "The University of Electro-Communications",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes two stability criteria for polynomial fuzzy systems by applying minimum-type and maximum-type piecewise polynomial Lyapunov functions (PPLFs) respectively. Piecewise Lyapunov functions and polynomial Lyapunov functions (PLFs) have been utilized to the stability analysis for fuzzy-model-based (FMB) control systems to obtain relaxed results in literature. However, the minimum-type and maximum-type PPLFs have not been employed to analyze the stability of FMB control systems. Therefore, this paper applies the minimum-type and maximum-type PPLFs to the stability analysis of polynomial FMB control systems. Two relaxed stability criteria represented in terms of bilinear sum-of-squares (SOS) conditions are proposed. The proposed stability criteria are represented in terms of bilinear SOS conditions that cannot be directly solved by the mathematical tools of solving SOS optimization problem (e.g. SOSTOOLS and SOSOPT). Therefore, the path-following method that has been shown to be effective for the nonconvex bilinear matrix inequality problem is employed for solving the bilinear SOS problem of the proposed stability criteria. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the relaxation of the proposed stability criteria.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the conditions related to singular configurations with unconstrained links and present related theorems and lemmas for a snake robot and an articulated mobile robot. A snake robot and an articulated mobile robot have links that have passive or active wheels and the links are serially connected by active joints. The singular configuration should be avoided if the robots are automatically controlled because they cannot execute intended motion when they are in the singular configuration. We derive a novel necessary and sufficient condition for the singular configurations of the snake robot; this removes some limitations of the traditional condition for a snake robot without unconstrained links. We also derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the singular configurations of the articulated mobile robot, and the structural conditions under which a real articulated mobile robot does not have a singular configuration. These conditions are proved by analyzing the elements of matrices included in the kinematic model and considering the geometrical meaning of the elements. In addition, we propose evaluation indices representing the distance from the singular configurations of a snake robot. We verify the effectiveness of these indices through simulations.",

        "organization": "The University of Electro-Communications",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes shared control in wireless-based remote stabilization for nonlinear systems. Shared control that is newly named in this paper can be regarded as simultaneous stabilization of plural nonlinear systems (in different places) by a single (common) controller. This paper consists of two parts. The first part addresses the basis of wireless-based remote stabilization for a single nonlinear system with time-varying delay. We derive a delay-dependent sufficient condition for ensuring the stability of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models with time-varying delays that are globally (or semiglobally at least) equivalent to nonlinear systems with wireless communication time delays. A feature of the derived condition is to be able to obtain the maximum time delay for ensuring the stability of wireless-based remote control system for given feedback gains. The second part presents shared control of plural nonlinear systems via a single controller. To design a (common) shared controller to stabilize plural nonlinear systems, we derive also a shared control version of the stability condition for T-S fuzzy models with time-varying delays. Design examples demonstrate the utility of this proposed design approach.",

We used a passive wheeled snake robot that can switch the grounded/lifted status of its wheels. We derived a kinematic model of the robot that represents its redundancy as both joint angles [the shape controllable points (SCPs)] and the null space of the control input. In the control method, the shape is changed by sequential control of the SCPs, and the null space of the control input is used for joint limit and self-collision avoidance. Jumps in control input do not occur, although the controlled variable and the model are switched. Simulations and an experiment were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a cost-effective design based on sensor reduction for backing-up control of a vehicle with triple trailers. To realize a cost-effective design, we newly derive two linear-matrix-inequality (LMI) conditions for a discrete Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system. One is an optimal dynamic output feedback design that guarantees desired control performance. The other is an avoidance of jackknife phenomenon for the use of the optimal dynamic output feedback controller. Our results demonstrate that the proposed LMI-based design effectively achieves the backing-up control of the vehicle with triple trailers while avoiding the jackknife phenomenon. More importantly, we demonstrate that the designed optimal control can achieve the backing-up control without, at least, two potentiometers that were employed to measure the relative angles (of a vehicle with triple trailers) in our previous experiments. Since the relative angles directly relate to the jackknife phenomenon, the successful control results without two potentiometers are very interesting and important from the cost-effective design point of view.",

In the proposed system, an operator indicates the desired velocity of the first link of the robot using a joystick, and the joint input which accomplishes both the desired velocity of the first link and collision avoidance between subsequent links and obstacles is automatically calculated by the controller, which selects the links needed to be grounded and exploits redundancy. The controller uses real-time data from range sensors for obstacle positions. The experimental system, which has range sensors and the function generating environmental map using simultaneous localization and mapping, was developed with decreasing calculation cost, and experiments were performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system in unknown environments.",

In most of the research, based on visual information of video cameras fixed to a ceiling, the mobile robots detect their own position. However, since the video cameras are fixed to a ceiling, there is a problem that the experimental field is limited. The goal of our research is to support the detection of the robots' position by using micro-helicopter with micro-camera to extend the experimental field freely. As the first step to the goal, this paper presents flight control of micro helicopter with coaxial counter-rotating blades.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes control method for a snake robot to ascend and descend steps. In a multiplane step environment, it is necessary for locomotion to transfer from one plane to another. When a snake robot moves, it touches several planes as its body is long and thin. In this paper, we propose a control method to track the trajectory of a snake robot in a step environment. We decomposed the 3-D motion of the robot into two simple models by introducing an assumption that simplifies the model and controller, and derive a model of the robot as a hybrid system with switching. The control method consists of a tracking controller, a method for shifting the robot's part connecting the planes, and active lifting to control the shape of the robot. Ascent and descent experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed controller and the method for shifting the connecting part of the robot's body.",

The automatic model construction and controller design are realized using the framework of a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling and control. Any trimmed equilibriums in addition to the complicated dynamics describing in an F16 aircraft simulator are considered and automatically converted to T-S fuzzy models around any trimmed equilibriums. A linear matrix inequality based design is carried out to automatically obtain stable nonlinear T-S fuzzy controllers according to the considered trimmed equilibriums. Control performance of the designed controllers are tested for the original dynamics (not T-S fuzzy models). The testing results demonstrate the utility of the practical design approach to automatic model construction and controller design.",

        "abstract": "The term “fuzzy modeling” was used in [30]. After that, pioneer works in the field of fuzzy modeling were done in [26, 31]. In 80’s, several fuzzy modeling techniques were developed (e.g., [24], [25], and [27]). In particular, Takagi and Sugeno [11] proposed a new type of fuzzy model. The model is called “Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model (T-S fuzzy model)”. Furthermore, they proposed a procedure to identify the T-S fuzzy model from input-output data of systems in [11]. This work has been referred in many papers on fuzzy modeling for a long time. Sugeno and Kang [9, 10] extended the T-S procedure. It consists of parameter identification and structure identification. They stated in [10] that the structure identification is important and the method is better than GMDH1 in prediction problems for complex systems.",

We clarify an appropriate condition of contact between the robot and planes and design a controller for the part of the robot connecting the two planes that satisfies the contact condition. Assuming that the contact condition is satisfied, we derive a simplified model of the robot and design a controller for trajectory tracking of the robot’s head. The controller uses kinematic redundancy to avoid violating the limit of the joint angle and a collision between the robot and the edge of a plane. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in experiments using an actual robot.",

        "abstract": "This correspondence paper presents a framework for practical model construction and stable altitude control of an unmanned aerial vehicle with a parafoil-type wing (UAV-PW). To design a stable controller, we first construct a dynamical longitudinal model of the UAV-PW. Since there exist no aerodynamics data of the parafoil shape in our UAV-PW, aerodynamics coefficients balanced at the trimmed equilibrium are employed. The model accuracy is investigated by comparing the model outputs with the real test flight experimental data. Next, stable controller design conditions for the UAV-PW model with uncertainties are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). By solving the LMI conditions, we design a stable controller that asymptotically stabilizes the UAV-PW model with the uncertainties on a considered operation domain. The experimental results demonstrate the viability of the model construction and the stable altitude control.",

        "organization": "The University of Electro-Communications",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a waypoint following control design for a powered paraglider (PPG) model. After constructing a dynamic model with six degrees of freedom of the PPG, a dynamical lateral model around a trim equilibrium in the steady-state flight is obtained. Unknown parameters, such as the moment of inertia, the drag coefficient, etc., in the lateral model are optimized by real flight experimental data. The model output with the optimized parameters agrees with the real flight experimental data. Since the aerodynamics-related parameter, i.e., the drag coefficient, might be slightly changed even near the considered trim equilibrium, this paper considers its uncertainty in the constructed lateral model. A nonlinear controller to stabilize the lateral model (with the aerodynamic uncertainty) on a considered operation domain is designed by solving robust controller design conditions expressed in terms of linear matrix inequality. The experimental results including automatic landing demonstrate the effectiveness of the control system design framework, i.e., the model construction and the robust stable control, considering the model uncertainty. ",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the improvement of the simulation model and the development of the new mechanism for flight control of a flying robot with the cyclogyro wing. In past study, we focused high maneuverability of the flying robots with the cyclogyro wing, whose rotor had rotation along horizontal axis, and developed some prototypes. The simulation model was also constructed based on the pressure of air. However the Reynolds number was not considered in the constructed simulation model. As a results, the model's accuracy was not enough. On the other hand, the control mechanism for the flight of cyclogyro wing is not yet developed. In this paper, the simulation model is improved by considering the cyclogyro's Reynolds number. The utility of the improved simulation model is verified by comparing simulation results with experimental results. Moreover the new mechanism is suggested for the flight control by controlling the generated force direction. The prototype of the new mechanism is developed and validated by the experiment.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents stability analysis of nonlinear systems using a new type of Lyapunov functions. We define so-called multiple mixed max-min based Lyapunov functions that contain existing piecewise Lyapunov functions as a special case. The extension is realized by multiple mixed connection of max and min operations for plural local quadratic functions. Hence, stability analysis discussed in this paper is more relaxed than those based on existing piecewise Lyapunov functions in addition to quadratic Lyapunov functions. Relaxed stability conditions based on multiple mixed max-min based Lyapunov functions are derived by considering switching conditions among the plural local quadratic functions. The derived stability conditions are represented in terms of bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). Unfortunately, BMIs cannot be generally solved via LMI solvers. Therefore, to simply solve BMIs, we propose a practical way that combines an LMI solver and particle swarm optimization. In this paper, two analytical examples are provided. The examples illustrate that our approach provides more relaxed stability results than existing piecewise Lyapunov functions approaches.",

Ten years is at the same time a long period and short time thinking to the inner dynamics of research. This paper, presented for these 50 years of Fuzzy Sets is taking into account both thoughts. A first part presents a quick recap of the history of fuzzy control: from model-free design, based on human reasoning to quasi-LPV (Linear Parameter Varying) model-based control design via some milestones, and key applications. The second part shows where we arrived and what the improvements are since the milestone of the first 40 years. A last part is devoted to discussion and possible future research topics.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, an intelligent nonsingular terminal sliding-mode control (INTSMC) system, which is composed of a terminal neural controller and a robust compensator, is proposed for an unknown nonlinear system. The terminal neural controller including a perturbed fuzzy neural network (PFNN) is the main controller and the robust compensator is designed to eliminate the effect of the approximation error introduced by the PFNN upon the system stability. The PFNN is used to approximate an unknown nonlinear term of the system dynamics and perturbed asymmetric membership functions are used to handle rule uncertainties when it is hard to exactly determine the grade of membership functions. In additional, Lyapunov stability theory is used to discuss the parameter learning and system stability of the INTSMC system. Finally, the proposed INTSMC system is applied to an inverted pendulum and a voice coil motor actuator. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed INTSMC system can achieve favorable tracking performance and is robust against parameter variations in the plant.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a piecewise polynomial Lyapunov function (PPLF) approach to stabilization and robust stabilization of polynomial fuzzy systems that are a generalized form of the well-known Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems. Both stabilization and robust stabilization conditions are formulated as sum of squares (SOS) optimization problems which can be solved by an SOS solver. A switching polynomial fuzzy controller based on switching information on the PPLF is designed to stabilize both polynomial fuzzy systems and polynomial fuzzy systems with uncertainties. In particular, by fully considering the properties of the piecewise and polynomial Lyapunov function, some relaxation are carried out in the derivation of SOS robust stabilization conditions for polynomial fuzzy systems with uncertainties. Four design examples are demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed design approach in comparison with the existing approaches, i.e., linear matrix inequalities approaches and SOS stabilization and robust stabilization approaches.",

        "organization": "The University of Electro-Communications",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a nonconvex criterion represented in terms of bilinear sum of squares (SOS) conditions for the stabilization of polynomial fuzzy systems. In the existing literature dealing with the stabilization of polynomial fuzzy control systems, the construction of Lyapunov function candidates is restricted in order to transform the nonconvex SOS conditions into convex SOS conditions. Moreover, the transformation from nonconvex conditions into convex conditions itself also induces some conservativeness for the stabilization of polynomial fuzzy control systems. This study proposes a stabilization criterion for polynomial fuzzy control systems remaining in the nonconvex form of bilinear SOS conditions. Therefore, the proposed nonconvex SOS stabilization criterion, in some way, can provide more relaxed results than the existing convex SOS stabilization criteria. Moreover, the restriction on the construction of Lyapunov function candidates in literature does not exist in the proposed nonconvex stabilization criterion. An iterative algorithm is utilized to obtain solutions of the nonconvex stabilization criterion represented in terms of bilinear SOS conditions. The iterative algorithm does not guarantee either to obtain the global optimum of the nonconvex criterion or even to converge. However, this algorithm is easy to implement and can yield feasible solutions efficiently in the design example of this work.",

        "abstract": "This paper addresses the static output feedback (SOF) control problem of Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy systems subject to both control input and state constraints. A new parameter-dependent sector condition is proposed to deal with the input saturation in SOF control context. Based on a judicious use of Finsler’s lemma in fuzzy Lyapunov control framework, new design conditions guaranteeing the existence of a stabilizing controller are recast as an LMI-based optimization with additional slack variables. These extra variables offer more flexibility to reduce the design conservatism. In particular, the proposed method requires neither special constraints on the state-space system matrices nor linear matrix equalities, which are hard to be satisfied. Several numerical examples are given to demonstrate the interests of the new control method.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new nonconvex design algorithm for guaranteed cost control of polynomial fuzzy systems that include the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy systems as a special case. We derive a sum-of-squares (SOS) noconvex conditions to achieve guaranteed cost control of polynomial fuzzy systems. Although SOS-based design approaches are regarded as a post LMI-based design approach, there exist some remaining problems to be solved in systems analysis and design. To solve the remaining problems of the SOS-based design approaches, this paper gives new ideas that directly solve nonconvex SOS design conditions in guaranteed cost control using the so-called path-following algorithm. In particular, we bring a new scheme that minimizes the upper bound of a given performance function in parallel with minimizing a parameter of checking non-negativity for SOS design conditions. The two parameters minimization in the path-following algorithm is realized by introducing a double-loop structure. Finally, two complex nonlinear system design examples (a polynomial chaotic system and a complicated nonlinear system) are employed to illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed nonconvex design algorithm for guaranteed cost control of polynomial fuzzy systems.",

The algorithm using steady state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) effectively realizes a real-time estimation of perceptual dominance in binocular rivalry from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For accuracy of estimation, the algorithm utilizes the EEG spectrogram obtained via the short-time Fourier transformation with a short time analysis window. More importantly, the algorithm focuses on the acceleration (second-order time differential) of the spectrogram difference between SSVEP of left-eye stimulus and that of right-eye stimulus, where the left-eye stimulus and the right-eye stimulus are separately displayed for left-eye and right-eye, respectively, with different-flashing-frequency visual stimuli of dissimilar images. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of the algorithm, particularly, the importance of introducing the acceleration of the spectrogram difference. With the simplicity of the algorithm, it is in fact suitable to accurately measure binocular rivalry without verbal communications in real-time environments. ",

First, the construction method of the augmented fuzzy system for continuous-time nonlinear systems is proposed by differentiating the original nonlinear system. Second, the dynamic fuzzy servo controller and the dynamic fuzzy model following controller, which can make outputs of the nonlinear system converge to target points and to outputs of the reference system, respectively, are introduced. Finally, the servo and model following controller design conditions are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Design examples illustrate the utility of this approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a polynomial fuzzy observer design for a wider class of polynomial fuzzy systems via a sum of squares (SOS, for brevity) approach. The proposed SOS-based framework provides a number of innovations and improvements over the existing LMI-based approaches to Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy controller and observer designs. First, we briefly summarize previous results for a class of polynomial fuzzy systems that is more general representation of the well-known T-S fuzzy system. Next, we propose a polynomial fuzzy observer to estimate states in a wider class of polynomial fuzzy systems and derive SOS conditions to design polynomial fuzzy controllers and observers. A remarkable feature of the SOS design conditions is that they realize the so-called separation principle, that is, that a polynomial fuzzy controller and observer for this class can be separately designed without lack of guaranteeing the stability of the overall control system in addition to converging state estimation error (via the observer) to zero. The design conditions in the proposed approach can be represented in terms of SOS and are symbolically and numerically solved via the recent developed SOSTOOLS and a semidefinite program (SDP) solver, respectively. To illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed approach, a design example is provided. The example demonstrates advantages of the SOS-based approach for the existing LMI approaches to T-S fuzzy observer designs.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents servo control for nonlinear systems with constraints on both of inputs and states using the fuzzy model-based control approach. In our previous paper, we proposed servo control with input constraint by introducing input difference between present input and final input. However, it is difficult to constrain both of state of the nonlinear systems and the control input at the same time since time-derivatives of state are used. In this paper, we construct the nonlinear error system based on error vector between state and the target point for servo control. By employing the error system representation and the input difference, servo control with constraints on both of inputs and states can be achieved. We derive LMI conditions for designing servo controller and for constraining control inputs and states. Servo controller with constraints is designed by simultaneously solving servo controller design condition and the constraint conditions. A design example illustrates the utility of this approach.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method for stabilization analysis of the single-input polynomial fuzzy systems using a sum of squares (SOS) approach to construct control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) for the systems. First, we represent a nonlinear system as a polynomial fuzzy system. Then, sufficient conditions in SOS terms for a positive definite function to become a CLF is presented. We solve the sufficient conditions using SOS optimization technique to construct the CLF. Finally, after a CLF is constructed, the controller for the system is designed using Sontag's formula. To illustrate the validity of the proposed approach, a design example is provided.",

The use of switching constraints associated with grounded/lifted wheels is an effective method of controlling various motions; e.g. the avoidance of a moving obstacle. A model of an articulated mobile robot that has active and passive wheels and active joints with switching constraints is derived. A controller that accomplishes the trajectory tracking of the robot’s head and subtasks using smooth joint input is proposed on the basis of the model.

The so-called parallel tracking and mapping (PTAM) technique using a small single wireless camera on the helicopter is utilized to detect the position and attitude of the helicopter. We construct the measurement system that is able to calibrate the mapping between local coordinate system in the PTAM and world coordinate system and is able to realize noise detection and elimination. In addition, we design the guaranteed cost (stable) controller for the dynamics of the helicopter via a linear matrix inequality approach. Although path tracking control only via the small single wireless vision sensor is a quite difficult task, the control results demonstrate the utility of our approach.",

First, we present a polynomial fuzzy model and controller that are more general representations of the well-known Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model and controller, respectively. Second, we derive a guaranteed cost control design condition based on polynomial Lyapunov functions. Hence, the design approach discussed in this paper is more general than the existing LMI approaches (to T-S fuzzy control system designs) based on quadratic Lyapunov functions. The design condition realizes a guaranteed cost control by minimizing the upper bound of a given performance function. In addition, the design condition in the proposed approach can be represented in terms of SOS and is numerically (partially symbolically) solved via the recent developed SOSTOOLS. To illustrate the validity of the design approach, two design examples are provided. The first example deals with a complicated nonlinear system. The second example presents micro helicopter control. Both the examples show that our approach provides more extensive design results for the existing LMI approach.",

        "organization": "The University of Electro-Communications",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a sum-of-squares (SOS) approach to polynomial fuzzy observer designs for three classes of polynomial fuzzy systems. The proposed SOS-based framework provides a number of innovations and improvements over the existing linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based approaches to Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy controller and observer designs. First, we briefly summarize previous results with respect to a polynomial fuzzy system that is a more general representation of the well-known T-S fuzzy system. Next, we propose polynomial fuzzy observers to estimate states in three classes of polynomial fuzzy systems and derive SOS conditions to design polynomial fuzzy controllers and observers. A remarkable feature of the SOS design conditions for the first two classes (Classes I and II) is that they realize the so-called separation principle, i.e., the polynomial fuzzy controller and observer for each class can be separately designed without lack of guaranteeing the stability of the overall control system in addition to converging state-estimation error (via the observer) to zero. Although, for the last class (Class III), the separation principle does not hold, we propose an algorithm to design polynomial fuzzy controller and observer satisfying the stability of the overall control system in addition to converging state-estimation error (via the observer) to zero. All the design conditions in the proposed approach can be represented in terms of SOS and are symbolically and numerically solved via the recently developed SOSTOOLS and a semidefinite-program solver, respectively. To illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed approach, three design examples are provided. The examples demonstrate the advantages of the SOS-based approaches for the existing LMI approaches to T-S fuzzy observer designs. ",

        "organization": "The University of Electro-Communications",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a practical approach of nonlinear control of the F16 aircraft via multiple nonlinear model generation for any trimmed equilibriums. The approach is realized using the framework of a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling and control. The nonlinear control algorithm consists of three parts. The first part determines a trimmed equilibrium of the F16 dynamics for a given desired flight condition. The second part generates a T-S fuzzy model from the F16 dynamics around the trimmed equilibrium determined in the first part. In the third part, a linear matrix inequality based design is carried out to automatically design a T-S fuzzy controller satisfying some kinds of performance from the T-S fuzzy model generated in the second part. Since there are an infinite number of trimmed equilibriums in the F16 dynamics and the trimmed equilibriums widely change according to different flight conditions, T-S fuzzy models are multiply re-generated according to widely change of the trimmed equilibriums. T-S fuzzy controllers are also re-designed from re-generated T-S fuzzy models whenever different desired flight conditions are selected. Control performance of the proposed control is tested for the original dynamics (not T-S fuzzy models). The testing results demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach of nonlinear control of the F16 aircraft via multiple nonlinear model generation for any trimmed equilibriums.",

        "organization": "The University of Electro-Communications",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a control solution for the stabilization of the 3-DOF RC helicopter via the combination of the TP (Tensor Product) model transformation and the PDC (Parallel Distributed Compensation) control design framework. First we recall the nonlinear model of the RC helicopter and its simplified version, in order, to facilitate control design. Then we execute the TP model transformation on the simplified model to yield its TP model representation, that is a kind of polytopic model with specific characteristics, whereupon the PDC framework can immediately be applied. The control design considers practical control specifications such as: good speed of response and physical constrain on the control effort to avoid actuator saturations. We guarantee these specifications by LMI (Linear Matrix Inequality) conditions developed under the PDC frameworks. Further, we avoid the discrepancies, introduced via the simplification of the model, by applying LMI conditions specialized for robust control. By simultaneously solving these LMI conditions, we render a stabilizing nonlinear controller that achieves good speed of response with small control effort without actuator saturations. Simulation results are included to validate the control design. It will be pointed out that the resulting controller is equivalent with the controller successfully applied in the real control experiment of the helicopter presented in a recent paper. The main conclusion of this paper is, that the proposed design process is systematic, non-heuristic and straightforward, the stability proof of the resulting controller is tractable via the feasibility test of LMIs and, hence, exact. The whole design procedure is automatically computed via commercialized mathematical tools (MATLAB LMI Toolbox) without analytical interaction. The computational time is about minutes on a regular PC.",

Furthermore, constraints on velocity and acceleration are taken into account, so that the snake robot can securely follow the generated trajectory.

This paper presents two control methods for this robot. The first is a 3-D steering method that is used to adapt the robot to the surrounding terrain. In this method, the robot relaxes its joints, allowing it to adapt to the terrain using its own weight, and then, resumes its motion employing the follow-the-leader method. The second control method is the semi-autonomous stair climbing method. In this method, the robot connects with the treads of the stairs using a body called a connecting part, and then shifts the connecting part from its head to its tail. The robot then uses the sensor information to shift the connecting part with appropriate timing. The robot can climb stairs using this method even if the stairs are steep, and the sizes of the riser and the tread of the stairs are unknown. Experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and the developed robot",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes sum-of-squares (SOS) methodologies for stability analysis and region-of-attraction (ROA) estimation for nonlinear systems represented by polynomial fuzzy models via piecewise polynomial Lyapunov functions (PPLFs). At first, two SOS-based global stability criteria are proposed by applying maximum-type and minimum-type PPLFs, respectively. It is known that less-conservative results can be obtained by reducing global stability to local stability, since it is usually the case for nonlinear systems that the stability cannot be reached globally. Therefore, based on the two types of PPLFs, two local stability criteria are further proposed with the algorithms that enlarge the estimated ROA as much as possible. The constraints for checking (global and local) stability and enlarging the estimated ROA are represented in terms of bilinear SOS problems. Hence, the path-following method is applied to solve the bilinear SOS problems in the proposed methodologies. Finally, some examples are provided to illustrate the utility of the proposed methodologies.",

First, we briefly summarize previous works on SOS-based observer designs for two limited classes of polynomial fuzzy systems. To overcome the difficulty of the fact that does not realize the so-called separation principle design for the more general class, this paper provides a practical design procedure of a polynomial fuzzy controller and a polynomial fuzzy observer without lack of guaranteeing the stability of the overall control system in addition to converging state estimation error (via the observer) to zero. The design approach discussed in this paper is more general than the existing LMI approaches (to T-S fuzzy controller and observer designs) and also than the previous SOS-based observer designs. To illustrate the validity of the design approach, a design example is provided. The example shows the utility of our SOS approach to the polynomial fuzzy observer-based control for the more general class of polynomial fuzzy systems.",

        "abstract": "This paper deals with a sum-of-squares (SOS)-based control Lyapunov function (CLF) design for polynomial fuzzy control of nonlinear systems. The design starts with exactly replacing (smooth) nonlinear systems dynamics with polynomial fuzzy models, which are known as universal approximators. Next, global stabilization conditions represented in terms of SOS are provided in the framework of the CLF design, i.e., a stabilizing controller with nonparallel distributed compensation form is explicitly designed by applying Sontag's control law, once a CLF for a given nonlinear system is constructed. Furthermore, semiglobal stabilization conditions on operation domains are derived in the same fashion as in the global stabilization conditions. Both global and semiglobal stabilization problems are formulated as SOS optimization problems, which reduce to numerical feasibility problems. Five design examples are given to show the effectiveness of our proposed approach over the existing linear matrix inequality and SOS approaches.",

First, a mathematical dynamic model of a palm-size aerial vehicle with the proposed PAS is constructed. Stability analysis for the dynamics is carried out in terms of Lyapunov stability theory. The analysis results show that the proposed stabilizer guarantees passive stabilizing behavior, i.e., passive attitude recovering, of the aerial vehicle for small perturbations from a stability theory point of view.

        "organization": "The University of Electro-Communications",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a sum of squares (SOS) approach for modeling and control of nonlinear dynamical systems using polynomial fuzzy systems. The proposed SOS-based framework provides a number of innovations and improvements over the existing linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based approaches to Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling and control. First, we propose a polynomial fuzzy modeling and control framework that is more general and effective than the well-known T--S fuzzy modeling and control. Secondly, we obtain stability and stabilizability conditions of the polynomial fuzzy systems based on polynomial Lyapunov functions that contain quadratic Lyapunov functions as a special case. Hence, the stability and stabilizability conditions presented in this paper are more general and relaxed than those of the existing LMI-based approaches to T-S fuzzy modeling and control. Moreover, the derived stability and stabilizability conditions are represented in terms of SOS and can be numerically (partially symbolically) solved via the recently developed SOSTOOLS. To illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed approach, a number of analysis and design examples are provided. The first example shows that the SOS approach renders more relaxed stability results than those of both the LMI-based approaches and a polynomial system approach. The second example presents an extensive application of the SOS approach in comparison with a piecewise Lyapunov function approach. The last example is a design exercise that demonstrates the viability of the SOS-based approach to synthesizing a stabilizing controller.",

On a multi-plane step environment, it is necessary for locomotion to transfer from one plane to another. A snake robot can move with touching several planes as its body is long and thin. In this paper, we propose a control method for accomplishing trajectory tracking of a snake robot on a step environment. The control method consists of the tracking controller, the shifting method of the robot's part connecting between the planes, and the active lifting for controlling the shape of the robot. Simulations and experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed controller and the shifting method of the connecting part of the robot's body.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents switching fuzzy model construction based on optimal dividing planes. In our previous papers, we proposed the switching fuzzy model with arbitrary dividing planes. However, dividing planes have been selected by controller designers before constructing the switching fuzzy model. Unfortunately, it is difficult to find suitable dividing planes for complicated nonlinear systems. Moreover, the switching fuzzy models constructed from different dividing planes are different. Therefore, the model construction affects the stability analysis results. In this paper, we propose switching fuzzy model construction method using multi-dimensional sector nonlinearity concept based on optimal dividing planes. The linear consequent parts of the switching fuzzy model based on optimal dividing planes are constructed from sectors which have minimum distance between a nonlinear system and sectors, and have richer information of the nonlinear system than the consequent parts of the ordinary Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model. Two examples are provided to illustrate the validity of this approach.",

At first the methodology checks whether the considered system can be guaranteed to be locally asymptotically stable. After confirming that the system is guaranteed to be locally asymptotically stable, the methodology enlarges the invariant subset of the ROA as much as possible.

A number of practical applications, ranging from flying vehicles control (including micro helicopter control) to brain-machine cooperative control, are provided in the lecture. The theory and applications have been developed in our laboratory [1] at the University of Electro-Communications (UEC), Tokyo, Japan, in collaboration with Prof. Hua O. Wang and his laboratory [2] at Boston University, Boston, USA. Due to lack of space, this chapter focuses on a unified fuzzy model-based framework for modeling and control of a micro helicopter that is a key application in our research.",

        "title": "A New Sum-of-Squares Design Framework for Robust Control of Polynomial Fuzzy Systems With Uncertainties",
        "organization": "The University of Electro-Communications",
        "abstract": "This paper presents a new sum-of-squares (SOS, for brevity) design framework for robust control of polynomial fuzzy systems with uncertainties. Two kinds of robust stabilization conditions are derived in terms of SOS. One is global SOS robust stabilization conditions that guarantee the global and asymptotical stability of polynomial fuzzy control systems. The other is semiglobal SOS robust stabilization conditions. The latter is available for very complicated systems that are difficult to guarantee the global and asymptotical stability of polynomial fuzzy control systems. The main feature of all the SOS robust stabilization conditions derived in this paper are to be expressed as nonconvex formulations with respect to polynomial Lyapunov function parameters and polynomial feedback gains. Since a typical transformation from nonconvex SOS design conditions to convex SOS design conditions often results in some conservative issues, the new design framework presented in this paper gives key ideas to avoid the conservative issues. The first key idea is that we directly solve nonconvex SOS design conditions without applying the typical transformation. The second key idea is that we bring a so-called copositivity concept. These ideas provide some advantages in addition to relaxations. To solve our SOS robust stabilization conditions efficiently, we introduce a gradient algorithm formulated as a minimizing optimization problem of the upper bound of the time derivative of an SOS polynomial that can be regarded as a candidate of polynomial Lyapunov functions. Three design examples are provided to illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed design framework. The examples demonstrate advantages of our new SOS design framework for the existing linear matrix inequality approaches and the existing convex SOS approach.",

        "organization": "The University of Electro-Communications",
        "abstract": "This paper presents the stability analysis for polynomial fuzzy systems by utilizing the equality constraints of sum-of-squares (SOS) Program. Recently, T-S fuzzy systems have been extended to polynomial fuzzy systems, in which the consequent parts could be polynomial sub-systems. Moreover, stability and stabilization analyses for polynomial fuzzy systems have been done based on polynomial Lyapunov functions that contain quadratic Lyapunov functions as a special case. Since polynomials exist in the sub-systems and the positive definite matrices of the Lyapunov functions, the linear matrix inequality (LMI) tools are not valid for the polynomial analyses. Instead of LMI tools, SOSTOOLS of Matlab toolbox is applied to solve solutions for the polynomial analyses. The SOS program of SOSTOOLS can solve two kinds of constraints that are equality constraints and inequality constraints. The existing stability and stabilization analyses for polynomial fuzzy systems represent their conditions only in the inequality constraints. This paper analyzes the stability of the polynomial fuzzy systems by polynomial Lyapunov functions, and represents the new stability conditions not only in terms of the inequality constraints but also in terms of the equality constraints.",

We consider a wheeled snake robot that has passive wheels and active joints. The robot can switch the wheels that touch the ground by lifting the required parts of its body. The model of the robot becomes a kinematically redundant system if certain wheels are lifted. Using this kinematic redundancy, and selecting the appropriate lifted parts, we design a controller for approximate path tracking. Simulations and experimental results show that the proposed controller effectively reduces the path-tracking error for all joints of the snake robot.",
