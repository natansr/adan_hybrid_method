        "abstract": "The fern family Aspleniaceae is generally recognized to contain two genera: Asplenium Linnaeus (1753: 1078) and Hymenasplenium Hayata (1927: 712). The two genera differ from each other in the habit of rhizomes (Hayata 1927), stele structure of rhizomes (Hayata 1927, 1928, Bir 1957, 1970), and chromosome numbers (Manton 1950, Manton & Sledge 1954, Bir 1960). Molecular evidence resolved the two genera as sister to each other (Murakami et al. 1999, Gastony & Johnson 2001, Schneider et al. 2004, 2017, Ohlsen et al. 2015, Lóriga et al. 2016). In working on the taxonomy of Asian Hymenasplenium, one name Asplenium pubirhizoma Ching & Z. Y.Liu (1983:7) came to our attention. Lin & Viane (2013) noted that “Asplenium pubirhizoma Ching & Z.Y.Liu, described from Sichuan [Chongqing], may represent a species of its own although it was considered a synonym of A. unilaterale Lamarck (1786: 305) s.l. by Wu (FRPS 4(2): 38. 1999); it is similar to Hymenasplenium murakami-hatanakae Nakaike (1992: 841) but differs in its gray, hairy cales and its more medial sori.” After careful morphological study by comparing the type of A. pubirhizoma with that of H. murakami-hatanakae (Type: CHINA. Taiwan: In monte Tampui Cascades, November 1913, Faurie 151, S-P- 1599!), we agree with Lin & Viane (2013) that the gray scales and medial sori of A. pubirhizoma are different from the brown to dark brown scales and (sub)marginal sori of H. murakami-hatanakae, and officially transfer this species from Asplenium to Hymenasplenium.",

The newly defined Leptochilus is then characterized by having an epiphytic habit, simple sterile leaves (except in Kontumia), and much contracted fertile leaves fully covered (except in Kontumia) with sori (acrostichoid sori). Following the results of a new molecular phylogeny (Zhang et al. in press) and morphological study nine new combinations in Leptochilus were made recently (Zhang et al. 2018) including L. fluviatilis (Lauterbach 1910: 507) Liang Zhang & Li Bing Zhang in Zhang et al.

The circumscription and phylogeny of the genus have been ambiguous and its species had been included in various genera such as Colysis, Dendroglossa, Kontumia, Microsorum, and Paraleptochilus. Previous molecular studies sampled only 2–4 molecular markers and 2–16 accessions of Leptochilus. In the present study, DNA sequences of six plastid markers of 105 accessions representing ca. 40 species of Leptochilus, including types of Colysis, Kontumia, Leptochilus, and Paraleptochilus, 39 species of six non-Leptochilus genera of Microsoroideae, and one species of Pyrrosia, are used to infer a phylogeny. Our major results include: (1) Leptochilus is monophyletic and resolved as nested within the microsoroid ferns, but its relationships with other members of Microsoroideae are not well resolved; (2) Six well-supported major clades in Leptochilus are recognized, differing from one another in molecular, morphological, and geographical features; (3) Species related to L. macrophyllus representing earliest split in Leptochilus are identified; (4) The inclusion of Microsorum pteropus in Leptochilus is confirmed, whereas M. insigne is closely related to Leptochilus but not resolved as a member of the genus; (5) The species number of the genus is likely to double the most recent estimate following our study, and quite a few cryptic species should be recognized; and (6) A basal grade formed by three major clades is recovered and they are composed of species almost exclusively distributed at lower latitudes (the Malay Archipelago), whereas the shallow-level clades contain species distributed at mainly higher latitudes, suggesting that Leptochilus might have evolved at lower latitudes and progressively dispersed to and colonized higher latitudes.",

        "abstract": "Two relatively widespread and superficially similar fern species, frequently confused in herbarium collections and field surveys, reside in neotropical forests. These have long been called Tectaria draconoptera (D.C. Eaton) Copel. (in Philipp. J. Sci., C 2: 410. 1907) and Tectaria nicotianifolia (Baker) C. Chr. (Index Filic., Suppl. Tert.: 182. 1934), e.g., by Moran in Moran & Riba, Fl. Mesoamer. 1: 204–209. 1995. Although similar morphologically, they are clearly distinct. In fact, molecular analyses demonstrate that they are members of distantly related lineages within Tectariaceae (Moran & al. in Syst. Bot. 39: 384–395. 2014; Zhang & al. in Taxon 65: 723–738. 2016; Zhang & al. in Molec. Phylogen. Evol. 114: 295–333. 2017). Based on recent molecular phylogenetic studies, they have been treated (e.g., by Zhang & al., l.c. 2016; PPG 1 in J. Syst. Evol. 54: 563–603. 2017) in separate genera, as Draconopteris draconoptera (D.C. Eaton) Li Bing Zhang & Liang Zhang (in Taxon 65: 732. 2016) and Hypoderris nicotianifolia (Baker) R.C. Moran & al.
