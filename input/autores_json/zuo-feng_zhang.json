        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "The present study was designed to explore the association of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene insertion/deletion (I/D, rs4646994) polymorphism, plasma ACE activity, and circulating ACE mRNA expression with essential hypertension (EH) in a Chinese population. In addition, a new detection method for circulating ACE mRNA expression was explored. Methods:The research was approved by the ethics committee of Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Prevention and Control. Written informed consent was obtained prior to the investigation. 221 hypertensives (cases) and 221 normotensives (controls) were interviewed, subjected to a physical examination, and provided blood for biochemical and genetic tests. The ACE mRNA expression was analyzed by real time fluorescent quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (FQ-RT-PCR). We performed logistic regression to assess associations of ACE I/D genotypes, ACE activity, and ACE mRNA expression levels with hypertension. Results:The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the additive model (ID, DD versus II) of the ACE genotype revealed an association with hypertension with adjusted OR of 1.43(95% CI: 1.04-1.97), and ACE ID genotype with adjusted OR of 1.72(95% CI: 1.01-2.92), DD genotype with adjusted OR of 1.94(95% CI: 1.01-3.73), respectively. In addition, our data also indicate that plasma ACE activity (adjusted OR was 1.13(95% CI: 1.08-1.18)) was significantly related to hypertension. However, the plasma ACE mRNA expressions were not different between the cases and controls. Conclusion:ACE I/D polymorphism and ACE activity revealed significant influence on hypertension, while circulating ACE mRNA expression was not important factors associated with hypertension in this Chinese population. The detection of circulating ACE mRNA expression by FQ-RT-PCR might be a useful method for early screening and monitoring of EH.",

Our case-control study included 921 head and neck cancer cases and 806 controls. We obtained medical history information by administering questionnaires to both cases and controls. We used unconditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios for oral lesions and chronic conditions. Our study reported on strong associations between HNC risk and oral leukoplakia, oral submucous fibrosis, which is consistent with prior research. We also observed repetitive dental ulcer to be associated with HNC risk. Future studies may focus on studying the association between depression and HNC, using medical records or psychological evaluation results to get more accurate information about depression, with careful assessment of tobacco and alcohol history.",

        "abstract": "Although tobacco involuntary smoking is an established risk factor for lung cancer, the association with head and neck cancer (HNC) is not established. We aimed to investigate this potential association in an East Asian population. We conducted a multicenter case-control study in East Asia including eight centers. We restricted our analysis to never tobacco smokers (303 cases and 459 controls) and to never tobacco smokers/never alcohol drinkers (243 cases and 403 controls). Among never tobacco smokers, involuntary smoking was associated with a 1.47-fold increase in risk of HNC (95%CI = 1.02, 2.13) and a 1.8-fold increase in the risk of oral cavity cancer (95%CI = 1.14, 2.92). Among never tobacco smokers who were also never alcohol drinkers, increased risks were detected for more than 3 h per day of involuntary smoking exposure and for 15 or more years of exposure. A dose-response relation was suggested for frequency of exposure (p for trend = 0.014) and for years of exposure (p for trend = 0.010) for oral cavity cancer. We did not detect strong increases in the risk of the other HNC subsites. Our study supports the association between involuntary smoking and the risk of HNC. The association may be stronger for oral cavity cancer than for other HNC subsites.",

        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "Previous case–control studies have suggested that atopic allergic conditions (AACs) are inversely associated with pancreatic cancer, but this relationship has not been supported in many prospective settings. In this study, we investigated the influence of AACs (asthma, hay fever, or allergy) and the treatment of these conditions on pancreatic cancer risk among participants of the Multiethnic Cohort Study (MEC). AACs and antihistamine use were assessed via a baseline questionnaire when participants joined the MEC in 1993–1996. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for pancreatic cancer incidence by AACs and antihistamines were calculated using Cox regression, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, education, smoking status, family history of pancreatic cancer, body mass index, diabetes, and alcohol intake. We further evaluated associations among subgroups defined by age, sex, ethnicity, follow‐up time, and known pancreatic cancer risk factors. During an average 16‐year follow‐up, 1,455 incident cases of pancreatic cancer were identified among 187,226 white, African American, Latino, Japanese American, and Native Hawaiian men and women. AACs (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88–1.12) and antihistamines (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.78–1.07) were not clearly associated with pancreatic cancer incidence. While these associations were also null for most subgroups, we did observe protective associations of AACs (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.98) and antihistamines (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45–0.96) among the oldest participants (70+). Our results, in agreement with past prospective studies, suggest that AACs are not associated with pancreatic cancer in general, but the observed protective associations among the oldest age group may warrant future investigation.",

We quantified the impact of publication-related biases and heterogeneity in data analysis and presentation in summary estimates of the association between alcohol drinking and gastric cancer. We compared estimates obtained from conventional meta-analyses, using only data available in published reports from studies that take part in the Stomach Cancer Pooling (StoP) Project, with individual participant data pooled analyses including the same studies. A total of 22 studies from the StoP Project assessed the relation between alcohol intake and gastric cancer, 19 had specific data for levels of consumption and 18 according to cancer location; published reports addressing these associations were available from 18, 5 and 5 studies, respectively. The summary odds ratios [OR, (95%CI)] estimate obtained with published data for drinkers vs. non-drinkers was 10% higher than the one obtained with individual StoP data [18 vs. 22 studies: 1.21 (1.07–1.36) vs. 1.10 (0.99–1.23)] and more heterogeneous (I2: 63.6% vs 54.4%). In general, published data yielded less precise summary estimates (standard errors up to 2.6 times higher). Funnel plot analysis suggested publication bias. Meta-analyses of the association between alcohol drinking and gastric cancer tended to overestimate the magnitude of the effects, possibly due to publication bias. Additionally, individual participant data pooled analyses yielded more precise estimates for different levels of exposure or cancer subtypes.",

        "abstract": "Air pollution is a severe threat to public health globally, affecting everyone in developed and developing countries alike. Among different air pollutants, particulate matter (PM), particularly combustion-produced fine PM (PM2.5) has been shown to play a major role in inducing various adverse health effects. Strong associations have been demonstrated by epidemiological and toxicological studies between increases in PM2.5 concentrations and premature mortality, cardiopulmonary diseases, asthma and allergic sensitization, and lung cancer. The mechanisms of PM-induced toxicological effects are related to their size, chemical composition, lung clearance and retention, cellular oxidative stress responses and pro-inflammatory effects locally and systemically. Particles in the ultrafine range (<100 nm), although they have the highest number counts, surface area and organic chemical content, are often overlooked due to insufficient monitoring and risk assessment. Yet, ample studies have demonstrated that ambient ultrafine particles have higher toxic potential compared with PM2.5. In addition, the rapid development of nanotechnology, bringing ever-increasing production of nanomaterials, has raised concerns about the potential human exposure and health impacts. All these add to the complexity of PM-induced health effects that largely remains to be determined, and mechanistic understanding on the toxicological effects of ambient ultrafine particles and nanomaterials will be the focus of studies in the near future.",

This population-based case–control study evaluated the main effect of menstrual/reproductive factors on the risk of lung cancer, and the effect modification by smoking status. Multivariable unconditional logistic regression models were applied adjusted for age, income, education, county of residence, body mass index, smoking status, pack-years of smoking, and family history of lung cancer. Among 680 lung cancer cases and 1,808 controls, later menopause (at >54 vs. <46 years old) was associated with increased risk of lung cancer (SBOR, semi-Bayes adjusted odds ratio = 1.61, 95% PI, posterior interval = 1.10–2.36). More pregnancies (2 or 3 vs. 0 or 1) was associated with decreased risk (SBOR = 0.71, 95% PI = 0.53, 0.95). Ever being a smoker and having two or fewer pregnancies in one's lifetime could jointly increase the odds of lung cancer (RERI, relative excess risk due to interaction = 1.71, 95% CI = 0.03, 3.38). An increased number of ovulatory cycles was associated with increased risk of lung cancer (SBOR for 13 ovulatory cycles = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.00+, 1.04).",

We included 24 studies from the ILCCO collaboration. Random-effects panel logistic regression and cubic spline regression were used to estimate the effects of smoking behaviors on SCLC risk and explore their non-linearity. Further, we explored whether the risk of smoking on SCLC was mediated through COPD. This is the largest pooling study that provides improved understanding of smoking on SCLC, and further demonstrates a causal pathway through COPD that warrants further experimental study.",

        "abstract": "Diets rich in vegetables and fruit have been associated with reduced risk of gastric cancer, and there is suggestive evidence that citrus fruits have a protective role. Our study aimed at evaluating and quantifying the association between citrus fruit intake and gastric cancer risk. We conducted a one‐stage pooled analysis including 6,340 cases and 14,490 controls from 15 case–control studies from the stomach cancer pooling (StoP) project consortium. Odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of gastric cancer across study‐specific tertiles of citrus fruit intake (grams/week) were estimated by generalized linear mixed effect models, with logistic link function and random intercept for each study. The models were adjusted for sex, age, and the main recognized risk factors for gastric cancer. Compared to the first third of the distribution, the adjusted pooled OR (95% CI) for the highest third was 0.80 (0.73–0.87). The favourable effect of citrus fruits increased progressively until three servings/week and leveled off thereafter. The magnitude of the association was similar between cancer sub‐sites and histotypes. The analysis by geographic area showed no association in studies from the Americas. Our data confirm an inverse association between citrus fruits and gastric cancer and provide precise estimates of the magnitude of the association. However, the null association found in studies from America and in some previous cohort studies prevent to draw definite conclusions on a protective effect of citrus fruit consumption.",

        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "It is not clear whether alcohol consumption is associated with lung cancer risk. The relationship is likely confounded by smoking, complicating the interpretation of previous studies. We examined the association of alcohol consumption and lung cancer risk in a large pooled international sample, minimizing potential confounding of tobacco consumption by restricting analyses to never smokers. Our study included 22 case‐control and cohort studies with a total of 2548 never‐smoking lung cancer patients and 9362 never‐smoking controls from North America, Europe and Asia within the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) and SYNERGY Consortium. Alcohol consumption was categorized into amounts consumed (grams per day) and also modelled as a continuous variable using restricted cubic splines for potential non‐linearity. Analyses by histologic sub‐type were included. Associations by type of alcohol consumed (wine, beer and liquor) were also investigated. Alcohol consumption was inversely associated with lung cancer risk with evidence most strongly supporting lower risk for light and moderate drinkers relative to non‐drinkers (>0–4.9 g per day: OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.70–0.90; 5–9.9 g per day: OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.69–0.99; 10–19.9 g per day: OR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.65–0.96). Inverse associations were found for consumption of wine and liquor, but not beer. The results indicate that alcohol consumption is inversely associated with lung cancer risk, particularly among subjects with low to moderate consumption levels, and among wine and liquor drinkers, but not beer drinkers. Although our results should have no relevant bias from the confounding effect of smoking we cannot preclude that confounding by other factors contributed to the observed associations. Confounding in relation to the non‐drinker reference category may be of particular importance.",

        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "A few papers have considered reproducibility of a posteriori dietary patterns across populations, as well as pattern associations with head and neck cancer risk when multiple populations are available. We used individual-level pooled data from seven case–control studies (3,844 cases; 6,824 controls) participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology consortium. We simultaneously derived shared and study-specific a posteriori patterns with a novel approach called multi-study factor analysis applied to 23 nutrients. We derived odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx combined, and larynx, from logistic regression models. We identified three shared patterns that were reproducible across studies (75% variance explained): the Anti-oxidant vitamins and fiber (OR=0.57, CI: 0.41–0.78, highest vs. lowest score quintile) and the Fats (OR=0.80, CI: 0.67–0.95) patterns were inversely associated with oral and pharyngeal cancer risk. The Animal products and cereals (OR=1.5, CI: 1.1–2.1) and the Fats (OR=1.8, CI: 1.4–2.3) patterns were positively associated with laryngeal cancer risk, whereas a linear inverse trend in laryngeal cancer risk was evident for the Anti-oxidant vitamins and fiber pattern. We also identified four additional study-specific patterns, one for each of the four US studies examined. We named them all as Dairy products and breakfast cereals and two were associated with oral and pharyngeal cancer risk. Multi-study factor analysis provides insight into pattern reproducibility, and supports previous evidence on cross-country reproducibility of dietary patterns and on their association with head and neck cancer risk.",

        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is more frequent among men, though the magnitude of the association might be inaccurate due to potential misclassification of lifetime infection and publication bias. Moreover, infection is common, and most studies are cross-sectional. Thus, prevalence ratios (PRs) may be easier to interpret than odds ratios (ORs). The aim of this study was to quantify the association between sex and H. pylori infection using controls from 14 studies from the Stomach Cancer Pooling (StoP) Project. H. pylori infection was defined based on IgG serum antibody titers or multiplex serology. Participants were also classified as infected if gastric atrophy was present, based on histological examination or serum pepsinogen (PG) levels (PG I≤70 and PG I/II ratio≤3). Summary ORs and PRs, adjusted for age, social class and smoking, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were estimated through random-effects meta-analysis. Men had significantly higher OR (OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.04–1.70) and PR (PR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.00–1.10) of infection, with stronger associations among hospital-based or older controls. Results were similar when considering the presence of gastric atrophy to define infection status, particularly among participants older than 65 years. This collaborative pooled-analysis supports an independent effect of sex on the prevalence of H. pylori infection, while minimizing misclassification of lifetime infection status and publication bias.",

        "abstract": "MicroRNAs, small non-coding RNAs involved in gene regulation, are implicated in lymphomagenesis. We evaluated whether genetic variations in microRNA coding regions, binding sites, or biogenesis genes (collectively referred to as miRNA-SNPs) were associated with risk of AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma (AIDS-NHL), and serum levels of four lymphoma-related microRNAs. Twenty-five miRNA-SNPs were genotyped in 180 AIDS-NHL cases and 529 HIV-infected matched controls from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify serum microRNA levels. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) estimated using conditional logistic regression evaluated associations between miRNA-SNPs and AIDS-NHL risk. A semi-Bayes shrinkage approach was employed to reduce likelihood of false-positive associations. Adjusted mean ratios (MR) calculated using linear regression assessed associations between miRNA-SNPs and serum microRNA levels. This study suggests that a few miRNA-SNPs are associated with AIDS-NHL risk and may modulate miRNA expression. These results support a role for miRNA in AIDS-NHL and may highlight pathways to be targeted for risk stratification or therapeutics.",

        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "Previous studies on smokeless tobacco use and head and neck cancer (HNC) have found inconsistent and often imprecise estimates, with limited control for cigarette smoking. Using pooled data from 11 US case-control studies (1981–2006) of oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers (6,772 cases and 8,375 controls) in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) Consortium, we applied hierarchical logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for ever use, frequency of use, and duration of use of snuff and chewing tobacco separately for never and ever cigarette smokers. Ever use (versus never use) of snuff was strongly associated with HNC among never cigarette smokers (odds ratio (OR) = 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 2.70), particularly for oral cavity cancers (OR = 3.01, 95% CI: 1.63, 5.55). Although ever (versus never) tobacco chewing was weakly associated with HNC among never cigarette smokers (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 0.81, 1.77), analyses restricted to cancers of the oral cavity showed a stronger association (OR = 1.81, 95% CI: 1.04, 3.17). Few or no associations between each type of smokeless tobacco and HNC were observed among ever cigarette smokers, possibly reflecting residual confounding by smoking. Smokeless tobacco use appears to be associated with HNC, especially oral cancers, with snuff being more strongly associated than chewing tobacco.",

        "abstract": "Genetic variants and traits in metabolic signaling pathways may interact with obesity, physical activity, and exogenous estrogen (E), influencing postmenopausal breast cancer risk, but these inter-related pathways are incompletely understood. We used 75 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)/insulin resistance (IR) traits and signaling pathways, and data from 1003 postmenopausal women in Women’s Health Initiative Observation ancillary studies. Stratifying via obesity and lifestyle modifiers, we assessed the role of IGF-I/IR traits (fasting IGF-I, IGF-binding protein 3, insulin, glucose, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance) in breast cancer risk as a mediator or influencing factor. Our findings suggest that IGF-I/IR genetic variants interact with obesity and lifestyle factors, altering cancer risk partially through pathways other than IGF-I/IR traits. Unraveling gene–phenotype–lifestyle interactions will provide data on potential genetic targets in clinical trials for cancer prevention and intervention strategies to reduce breast cancer risk.",

        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "The role of consumption of added sugars in cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) is unclear. We examined associations between sugary beverages and susceptibility to UADT cancer as well as overall survival among UADT cancer patients. The association between dietary added sugar and susceptibility to UADT cancers or overall survival among 601 UADT cancer cases was evaluated using data from a population-based case–control study conducted in Los Angeles County. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for cancer susceptibility, and Cox regression was used to estimate hazards ratios (HRs) with 95 % CIs for survival, adjusting for relevant confounders. A total of 248 deaths were observed during follow-up (median 12.1 years). A positive association was observed with consumption of grams of sugar from beverages, including soft drinks and fruit juices, and poorer survival among UADT cancer cases (aHR, Q4 vs. Q1:1.88; 95 % CI 1.29, 2.72; p for trend = 0.002), as well as servings of sugary beverages (aHR, Q4 vs. Q1: 95 % CI 1.97, 95 % CI 1.32–2.93). This was due largely to consumption of sugars from soft drinks. Particularly, high consumption of sugary beverages was associated with poorer survival among esophageal cancer cases, driven by squamous cancers. No association was observed between sugary beverages and cancer susceptibility. These findings suggest that consumption of sugary beverages may decrease survival associated with UADT cancers. Additional studies should be conducted to examine survival among cancer patients consuming high amounts of added or refined sugars. Such studies may highlight prognostic factors for UADT cancers.",

We conducted a hospital-based multicenter case-control study in East Asia including 921 cases and 806 controls. We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for HNC risks by using logistic regression, adjusting on potential confounders. Compared to normal BMI at interview (18.5–<25 kg/m2), being underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2) was associated with a higher HNC risk (OR = 2.71, 95% CI  1.40–5.26). Additionally, obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) was associated with a lower HNC risk (OR = 0.30, 95% CI  0.16–0.57). Being underweight at age 20 was also associated with an increased risk of HNC. However, being underweight at 5 years or 2 years before interview was not associated with a higher risk of HNC.We observed an inverse association between BMI and HNC risk, which is consistent with previous studies in other geographic regions. Being underweight at age 20 was also associated with a higher risk of HNC, suggesting that reverse causality was not the main source of the association.",

        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "The possible role of dietary fiber in the etiology of head neck cancers (HNCs) is unclear. We used individual‐level pooled data from ten case‐control studies (5959 cases and 12,248 controls) participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) consortium, to examine the association between fiber intake and cancer of the oral cavity/pharynx and larynx. Odds Ratios (ORs) and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional multiple logistic regression applied to quintile categories of non‐alcohol energy‐adjusted fiber intake and adjusted for tobacco and alcohol use and other known or putative confounders. Fiber intake was inversely associated with oral and pharyngeal cancer combined (OR for 5th vs. 1st quintile category = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.40–0.59; p for trend <0.001) and with laryngeal cancer (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.54–0.82, p for trend <0.001). There was, however, appreciable heterogeneity of the estimated effect across studies for oral and pharyngeal cancer combined. Nonetheless, inverse associations were consistently observed for the subsites of oral and pharyngeal cancers and within most strata of the considered covariates, for both cancer sites. Our findings from a multicenter large‐scale pooled analysis suggest that, although in the presence of between‐study heterogeneity, a greater intake of fiber may lower HNC risk.",

This study aims to investigate the association of two ATM single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with lung cancer, as well as their potential interaction with p53 gene and other known risk factors of lung cancer.  population-based case–control study was conducted in Taiyuan city, China with 399 cases and 466 controls matched on the distribution of age and sex of cases. The two ATM gene SNPs, ATMrs227060 and ATMrs228589 as well as p53 gene SNP, p53rs1042522 were genotyped using Sequenom platform. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate crude and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Adjusted models controlled for age, sex, and smoking status. This study indicates that ATM gene variants might be associated with development of lung cancer in Chinese population. These results need to be validated in larger and different population samples.",

        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke on the incidence of lung adenocarcinoma in situ/minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (AIS/MIA). Data from seven case–control studies participating in the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) were pooled, resulting in 625 cases of AIS/MIA and 7,403 controls, of whom 170 cases and 3,035 controls were never smokers. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted ORs (ORadj) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), controlling for age, sex, race, smoking status (ever/never), and pack-years of smoking. Study center was included in the models as a random-effects intercept term. Ever versus never exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke was positively associated with AIS/MIA incidence in all subjects (ORadj = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.14–1.93) and in never smokers (ORadj = 1.45; 95% CI, 1.00–2.12). There was, however, appreciable heterogeneity of ORadj across studies (P = 0.01), and the pooled estimates were largely influenced by one large study (40% of all cases and 30% of all controls). These findings provide weak evidence for an effect of secondhand tobacco smoke exposure on AIS/MIA incidence. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of secondhand tobacco smoke exposure using the newly recommended classification of subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma.",

        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "Tobacco smoking is a known cause of gastric cancer, but several aspects of the association remain imprecisely quantified. We examined the relation between cigarette smoking and the risk of gastric cancer using a uniquely large dataset of 23 epidemiological studies within the ‘Stomach cancer Pooling (StoP) Project’, including 10 290 cases and 26 145 controls. We estimated summary odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by pooling study-specific ORs using random-effects models. Compared with never smokers, the ORs were 1.20 (95% CI: 1.09–1.32) for ever, 1.12 (95% CI: 0.99–1.27) for former, and 1.25 (95% CI: 1.11–1.40) for current cigarette smokers. Among current smokers, the risk increased with number of cigarettes per day to reach an OR of 1.32 (95% CI: 1.10–1.58) for smokers of more than 20 cigarettes per day. The risk increased with duration of smoking, to reach an OR of 1.33 (95% CI: 1.14–1.54) for more than 40 years of smoking and decreased with increasing time since stopping cigarette smoking (P for trend<0.01) and became similar to that of never smokers 10 years after stopping. Risks were somewhat higher for cardia than noncardia gastric cancer. Risks were similar when considering only studies with information on Helicobacter pylori infection and comparing all cases to H. pylori+ controls only. This study provides the most precise estimate of the detrimental effect of cigarette smoking on the risk of gastric cancer on the basis of individual data, including the relationship with dose and duration, and the decrease in risk following stopping smoking.",

        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "Inherited susceptibility to lung cancer risk in never-smokers is poorly understood. The major reason for this gap in knowledge is that this disease is relatively uncommon (except in Asians), making it difficult to assemble an adequate study sample. In this study we conducted a genome-wide association study on the largest, to date, set of European-descent never-smokers with lung cancer. We conducted a two-phase (discovery and replication) genome-wide association study in never-smokers of European descent. We further augmented the sample by performing a meta-analysis with never-smokers from the recent OncoArray study, which resulted in a total of 3636 cases and 6295 controls. We also compare our findings with those in smokers with lung cancer. We found that genetic susceptibility to lung cancer in never-smokers is associated to genetic variants with pan-cancer risk effects. The comparison with smokers shows that top variants previously shown to be associated with lung cancer risk only confer risk in the presence of tobacco exposure, underscoring the importance of gene-environment interactions in the etiology of this disease.",

        "abstract": "Genetic variants and traits in metabolic signaling pathways may interact with lifestyle factors such as obesity, physical activity, and exogenous estrogen (E), influencing postmenopausal colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, but these interrelated pathways are not fully understood. In this case-cohort study, we examined 33 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)/ insulin resistance (IR) traits and signaling pathways, using data from 704 postmenopausal women in Women’s Health Initiative Observation ancillary studies. Stratifying by the lifestyle modifiers, we assessed the effects of IGF-I/IR traits (fasting total and free IGF-I, IGF binding protein-3, insulin, glucose, and homeostatic model assessment–insulin resistance) on CRC risk as a mediator or influencing factor. Six SNPs in the INS, IGF-I, and IGFBP3 genes were associated with CRC risk, and those associations differed between non-obese/active and obese/inactive women and between E nonusers and users. Roughly 30% of the cancer risk due to the SNP was mediated by IGF-I/IR traits. Likewise, carriers of 11 SNPs in the IRS1 and AKT1/2 genes (signaling pathway–related genetic variants) had different associations with CRC risk between strata, and the proportion of the SNP–cancer association explained by traits varied from 30% to 50%. Our findings suggest that IGF-I/IR genetic variants interact with obesity, physical activity, and exogenous E, altering postmenopausal CRC risk, through IGF-I/IR traits, but also through different pathways. Unraveling gene–phenotype–lifestyle interactions will provide data on potential genetic targets in clinical trials for cancer prevention and intervention strategies to reduce CRC risk.",

        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "Recent meta-analyses show that individuals with high risk variants in CHRNA5 on chromosome 15q25 are likely to develop lung cancer earlier than those with low-risk genotypes. The same high-risk genetic variants also predict nicotine dependence and delayed smoking cessation. It is unclear whether smoking cessation confers the same benefits in terms of lung cancer risk reduction for those who possess CHRNA5 risk variants versus those who do not. Meta-analyses examined the association between smoking cessation and lung cancer risk in 15 studies of individuals with European ancestry who possessed varying rs16969968 genotypes (N = 12,690 ever smokers, including 6988 cases of lung cancer and 5702 controls) in the International Lung Cancer Consortium. We demonstrate that quitting smoking is highly beneficial in reducing lung cancer risks for smokers regardless of their CHRNA5 rs16969968 genetic risk status. Smokers with high-risk CHRNA5 genotypes, on average, can largely eliminate their elevated genetic risk for lung cancer by quitting smoking- cutting their risk of lung cancer in half and delaying its onset by 7 years for those who develop it. These results: 1) underscore the potential value of smoking cessation for all smokers, 2) suggest that CHRNA5 rs16969968 genotype affects lung cancer diagnosis through its effects on smoking, and 3) have potential value for framing preventive interventions for those who smoke.",

        "abstract": "Epidemiological results on the association between tea consumption and oral cancer remain controversial. We aimed to evaluate the exact relationship between tea consumption and oral cancer in Chinese population. A large-scale case–control study was conducted on 586 oral cancer patients and 1024 controls frequency-matched by age and gender. Epidemiological data were collected through face-to-face interviews with a structure questionnaire. Unconditional logistic regression model was used to assess the effect of tea consumption on oral cancer stratified by smoking, alcohol drinking and demographics. Quantity of tea consumed (ml/day) was categorized into five subgroups based on quartiles and then its interactions was evaluated with tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking at each subgroup. Tea consumption showed an inverse association with oral cancer for non-smokers or non-alcohol drinkers (the odds ratios (ORs) were 0.610 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.425–0.876) and 0.686 (95% CI: 0.503–0.934), respectively). For smokers or alcohol drinkers, decreased risk was only observed in those who consumed >800 ml/day. Furthermore, oolong tea consumption was associated with decreased risk of oral cancer in smokers or alcohol drinkers but not in non-smokers or non-alcohol drinkers. Tea consumption combined with smoking or/and alcohol drinking had a greater risk than tea consumption alone, but the risk was roughly reduced from zero to Q4 (>800 ml/day). Additionally, when stratified by demographics, the protective effect of tea was especially evident in females, urban residents, normal body mass index population (18.5–23.9), farmers, office workers and those aged <60 years. Tea consumption protects against oral cancer in non-smokers or non-alcohol drinkers, but this effect may be obscured in smokers or alcohol drinkers. Additionally, demographics may modify the association between tea consumption and oral cancer.",

        "abstract": "The effect of red and processed meats on cancer survival is unclear. We sought to examine the role of total and processed red meat consumption on all-cause mortality among patients with cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT) and lung, in order to test our hypothesis that red or processed meat was associated with overall mortality in these patients. Using data from a population-based case-control study conducted in Los Angeles County, we conducted a case-only analysis to examine the association of red or processed meat consumption on mortality after 12 years of follow-up, using a diet history questionnaire. Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for potential confounders. Of 601 UADT cancer cases and 611 lung cancer cases, there were 248 and 406 deaths, respectively, yielding crude mortality rates of 0.07 and 0.12 deaths per year. Comparing the highest with lowest quartile of red meat consumption, the adjusted HR was 1.64 (95% CI, 1.04-2.57) among UADT cancer cases; for red or processed meat, the adjusted HR was 1.76 (95% CI, 1.10-2.82). A dose-response trend was observed. A weaker association was observed with red meat consumption and overall mortality among lung cancer cases. In conclusion, this case-only analysis demonstrated that increased consumption of red or processed meats was associated with mortality among UADT cancer cases and WAS weakly associated with mortality among lung cancer cases.",

We evaluated associations between six immunity-related polymorphisms (CRP rs1205 and rs1800947, FGFR2 rs1219648 and rs2981582, IFNGR1 rs11914, and IL10 rs1800871) and overall survival among prostate cancer patients, calculating adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Cox proportional hazards regression. FGFR2 rs1219648 (GG vs. AA) and rs2981582 (TT vs. CC) polymorphisms were associated with more favorable overall survival (HR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03-0.62 and HR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.03-0.53, respectively) in patients with primary prostate cancer. These observations highlight the need to validate and identify these and other immunity-related polymorphisms in larger studies examining survival of prostate cancer patients.",

We examined the association between raw garlic consumption and lung cancer in a case–control study conducted between 2005 and 2007 in Taiyuan, China. Epidemiologic data was collected by face-to-face interviews from 399 incident lung cancer cases and 466 healthy controls. We used unconditional logistic regression models to estimate crude and adjusted ORs (aOR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Adjusted models controlled for age, sex, average annual household income 10 years ago, smoking, and indoor air pollution. The results of the current study suggest that raw garlic consumption is associated with reduced risk of lung cancer in a Chinese population.",

        "abstract": "Smoking has been associated with acquisition and increased persistence of Helicobacter pylori infection, as well as with lower effectiveness of its eradication. A greater prevalence of infection among smokers could contribute to the increased risk for gastric cancer. We aimed to estimate the association between smoking and seropositivity to H. pylori through an individual participant data pooled analysis using controls from 14 case–control studies participating in the Stomach Cancer Pooling Project. Summary odds ratios and prevalence ratios (PRs), adjusted for age, sex and social class, and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated through random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I2 statistic and publication bias with Egger’s test. There was no significant association between smoking (ever vs. never) and H. pylori seropositivity (adjusted odds ratio = 1.08; 95% CI: 0.89–1.32; adjusted PR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.98–1.05). The strength of the association did not increase with the intensity or duration of smoking; stratified analyses according to sex, age, region or type of sample did not yield a consistent pattern of variation or statistically significant results, except for participants younger than 55 years and who had been smoking for more than 30 years (adjusted PR = 1.08; 95% CI: 1.02–1.15). This is the first collaborative analysis providing pooled estimates for the association between smoking and H. pylori seropositivity, based on detailed and uniform information and adjusting for major covariates. The results do not support an association between smoking and H. pylori infection.",

        "abstract": "While disparity in pancreatic cancer incidence between blacks and whites has been observed, few studies have examined disparity in other ethnic minorities. We evaluated variations in pancreatic cancer incidence and assessed the extent to which known risk factors account for differences in pancreatic cancer risk among African Americans, Native Hawaiians, Japanese Americans, Latino Americans, and European Americans in the Multiethnic Cohort Study. Risk factor data were obtained from the baseline questionnaire. Cox regression was used to estimate the relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for pancreatic cancer associated with risk factors and ethnicity. During an average 16.9‐year follow‐up, 1,532 incident pancreatic cancer cases were identified among 184,559 at‐risk participants. Family history of pancreatic cancer (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.50‐2.58), diabetes (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.14‐1.54), body mass index ≥30 kg/m2 (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08‐1.46), current smoking (<20 pack‐years RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19‐1.73; ≥20 pack‐years RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.46‐2.12), and red meat intake (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.00‐1.36) were associated with pancreatic cancer. After adjustment for these risk factors, Native Hawaiians (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.30‐1.98), Japanese Americans (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.15‐1.54), and African Americans (RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.01‐1.42), but not Latino Americans (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76‐1.07), had a higher risk of pancreatic cancer compared to European Americans. Interethnic differences in pancreatic cancer risk are not fully explained by differences in the distribution of known risk factors. The greater risks in Native Hawaiians and Japanese Americans are new findings and elucidating the causes of these high rates may improve our understanding and prevention of pancreatic cancer.",

        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "Cancer is a major public health burden both globally and in China. The most common cancer-related deaths in China are attributable to cancers of the lung, liver, stomach, and esophagus. Previous epidemiologic studies on cancer in China have often been limited by small sample sizes, inconsistent measurements, and lack of precise and accurate data. The Jiangsu Four Cancers (JFC) Study is a population-based case-control study conducted in an effort to obtain consistent and high quality data to investigate the life style, behavioral, environmental, and genetic factors associated with the four major cancers in China. The objective of this paper is to describe the overall design of the JFC Study and report selected findings on the major risk factors of cancers. Epidemiologic data were collected from 2003 to 2010 through in-person interviews using a structured questionnaire, and blood samples were drawn. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the associations of putative risk factors with risks of cancers of the lung, liver, stomach, and esophagus. The JFC Study is one of the largest case-control studies of cancers in the Chinese population and will serve as a rich resource for future research on the four major cancers in China.",

        "abstract": "The role of tea or coffee on head and neck cancer (HNC) risk has not been consistent, especially in Asian populations. The aim of the study was to investigate whether tea or coffee is associated with HNC risks in a Chinese population. Our case–control study included 921 head and neck cancer cases and 806 controls. We obtained information on tea and coffee consumption frequency, duration, age at start, strength, and types. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). No association between tea drinking and HNC risk was observed after adjusting for potential confounders. Coffee drinking was inversely associated with oral cavity cancer risk with dose–response trends for both frequency (p for trend = 0.0149) and the duration (p for trend = 0.0167) of intake. When stratified by age, sex, and cigarette smoking, coffee drinking was not clearly associated with head and neck cancer risk in terms of frequency or duration.  Coffee consumption was associated with a decreased risk of oral cavity cancer. Further investigations with more specific tea consumption-related factors are warranted to examine the relationship between tea drinking and HNC risks.",

        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "There have been few published studies on differences between Blacks and Whites in the estimated effects of alcohol and tobacco use on the incidence of head and neck cancer (HNC) in the United States. Previous studies have been limited by small numbers of Blacks. Using pooled data from 13 US case–control studies of oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal cancers in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium, this study comprised a large number of Black HNC cases (n = 975). Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for several tobacco and alcohol consumption characteristics. Blacks were found to have consistently stronger associations than Whites for the majority of tobacco consumption variables. For example, compared to never smokers, Blacks who smoked cigarettes for > 30 years had an OR 4.53 (95% CI 3.22–6.39), which was larger than that observed in Whites (OR 3.01, 95% CI 2.73–3.33; pinteraction < 0.0001). The ORs for alcohol use were also larger among Blacks compared to Whites. Exclusion of oropharyngeal cases attenuated the racial differences in tobacco use associations but not alcohol use associations. These findings suggest modest racial differences exist in the association of HNC risk with tobacco and alcohol consumption.",

        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "There is inadequate evidence to determine whether there is an effect of alcohol consumption on lung cancer risk. We conducted a pooled analysis of data from the International Lung Cancer Consortium and the SYNERGY study to investigate this possible association by type of beverage with adjustment for other potential confounders. Twenty one case-control studies and one cohort study with alcohol-intake data obtained from questionnaires were included in this pooled analysis (19,149 cases and 362,340 controls). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) or hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for each measure of alcohol consumption. Effect estimates were combined using random or fixed-effects models where appropriate. Associations were examined for overall lung cancer and by histological type. We observed an inverse association between overall risk of lung cancer and consumption of alcoholic beverages compared to non-drinkers, but the association was not monotonic. The lowest risk was observed for persons who consumed 10–19.9 g/day ethanol (OR vs. non-drinkers = 0.78; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.91), where 1 drink is approximately 12–15 g. This J-shaped association was most prominent for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The association with all lung cancer varied little by type of alcoholic beverage, but there were notable differences for SCC. We observed an association with beer intake (OR for ≥20 g/day vs nondrinker = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.90).  Whether the non-monotonic associations we observed or the positive association between beer drinking and squamous cell carcinoma reflect real effects await future analyses and insights about possible biological mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "In 2012, more than 400,000 urinary bladder cancer cases occurred worldwide, making it the 7th most common type of cancer. Although many previous studies focused on the relationship between diet and bladder cancer, the evidence related to specific food items or nutrients that could be involved in the development of bladder cancer remains inconclusive. Dietary components can either be, or be activated into, potential carcinogens through metabolism, or act to prevent carcinogen damage. The BLadder cancer, Epidemiology and Nutritional Determinants (BLEND) study was set up with the purpose of collecting individual patient data from observational studies on diet and bladder cancer. In total, data from 11,261 bladder cancer cases and 675,532 non-cases from 18 case–control and 6 cohort studies from all over the world were included with the aim to investigate the association between individual food items, nutrients and dietary patterns and risk of developing bladder cancer. The substantial number of cases included in this study will enable us to provide evidence with large statistical power, for dietary recommendations on the prevention of bladder cancer.",

        "organization": "Professor and Associate Dean UCLA Fielding School of Public Health",
        "abstract": "Most mouthwashes contain alcohol, a known cause of head and neck cancer (oral cavity, pharynx, larynx), likely through the carcinogenic activity of acetaldehyde, formed in the oral cavity from alcohol. We conducted a pooled analysis of 8,981 cases of head and neck cancer and 10,090 controls from 12 case-control studies with comparable information on mouthwash use in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of mouthwash use with cancers of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx, adjusting for study, age, sex, pack-years of tobacco smoking, number of alcoholic drinks/day, and education. Compared with never users of mouthwash, the odds ratio (OR) of all head and neck cancers was 1.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94, 1.08) for ever users, based on 12 studies. The corresponding ORs of cancer of oral cavity and oropharynx were 1.11 (95% CI 1.00, 1.23) and 1.28 (95% CI 1.06 1.56), respectively. OR for all head and neck cancer was 1.15 (95% CI 1.01, 1.30) for use for more than 35 years, based on seven studies (p for linear trend=0.01), and OR 1.31 (95% CI 1.09 1.58) for use > 1 per day, based on five studies (p for linear trend <0.001). Although limited by the retrospective nature of the study and the limited ability to assess risks of mouthwash use in non-users of tobacco and alcohol, this large investigation reveals potential risks for head and neck cancer sub-sites and in long-term and frequent users of mouthwash.",

        "abstract": "Few studies have been conducted in China to investigate the association between diet and the risk of head-and-neck cancer (HNC). The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between diet and HNC risk in the Chinese population and to examine whether smoking status has any effect on the risk. Our multicenter case–control study included 921 HNC cases and 806 controls. We obtained information on the frequency of both animal- and plant-based food consumption. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). The risk of HNC increased with more frequent consumption of processed meat and fermented foods but decreased with frequent consumption of fruits and vegetables. There was a significant increasing P for trend of 0.006 among smokers who consumed meat and an increased OR among smokers who consumed processed meat (OR 2.95, 95%CI 1.12–7.75). Protective odds ratios for vegetable consumption were observed among smokers only. We also observed protective odds ratios for higher egg consumption among never-smokers (P for trend = 0.0.003). Reduced HNC risks were observed for high fruit and vegetable intake, a finding consistent with the results of previous studies. Processed meat intake was associated with an increased risk. The role of dietary factors in HNC in the East Asian population is similar to that in European populations.",

        "abstract": "Genetic variants in the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)/insulin resistance axis may interact with lifestyle factors, influencing postmenopausal breast cancer risk, but these interrelated pathways are not fully understood. In this study, we examined 54 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in genes related to IGF-I/insulin phenotypes and signaling pathways and lifestyle factors in relation to postmenopausal breast cancer, using data from 6,567 postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative Harmonized and Imputed Genome-Wide Association Studies. We used a machine-learning method, two-stage random survival forest analysis. We identified three genetic variants (AKT1 rs2494740, AKT1 rs2494744, and AKT1 rs2498789) and two lifestyle factors [body mass index (BMI) and dietary alcohol intake] as the top five most influential predictors for breast cancer risk. The combination of the three SNPs, BMI, and alcohol consumption (≥1 g/day) significantly increased the risk of breast cancer in a gene and lifestyle dose-dependent manner. Our findings provide insight into gene–lifestyle interactions and will enable researchers to focus on individuals with risk genotypes to promote intervention strategies.

        "abstract": "The smoking prevalence among men in China is high, but the head and neck cancer incidence rates are low. This study's purpose was to investigate the impact of tobacco, betel quid, and alcohol on head and neck cancer risk in East Asia. A multicenter case‐control study (921 patients with head and neck cancer and 806 controls) in East Asia was conducted. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using logistic regression. Head and neck cancer risks were elevated for tobacco (OR = 1.58), betel quid (OR = 8.23), and alcohol (OR = 2.29). The total attributable risk of tobacco and/or alcohol was 47.2%. Tobacco/alcohol appeared to account for a small proportion of head and neck cancer among women (attributable risk of 2.2%). Betel quid chewing alone accounted for 28.7% of head and neck cancer. Betel quid chewing is the strongest risk factor for oral cavity cancer in this Chinese population. Alcohol may play a larger role for head and neck cancer in this population than in European or U.S. populations.",
