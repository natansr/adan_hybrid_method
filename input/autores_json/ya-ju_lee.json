        "abstract": "We propose a novel, normally-off AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) governed by polarization engineering. The fundamental concept is to grade the Al composition of the barrier layer from GaN to AlxGa1‚àíxN, thereby alleviating the impact of piezoelectric polarization on the two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG) and establishing a conduction-band profile well above the Fermi energy. These effects lead to a positive shift in the threshold voltage of the device and benefit the normally-off operation. It is observed that the device‚Äôs DC transfer characteristics can be further modulated simply by adjusting the Al composition of the AlyGa1‚àíyN cap layer and the p-type doping concentration at the top of the GaN buffer layer. These findings, based on a physical simulation of the proposed device, provide a guideline for the implementation of highly efficient, normally-off AlGaN/GaN HEMTs.",

        "abstract": "In this work¬†ùëù-ZnO/ùëõ-GaNp-ZnO/n-GaN¬†heterojunction diodes were directly formed on the Si substrate by a combination of cost-effective solgel spin-coating and thermal annealing treatment. Spin-coated¬†ùëõn-ZnO films on InN/GaN/Si wafers were converted to¬†ùëùp-type polarity after thermal treatment of proper annealing durations. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis reveals that InN-codoped ZnO films have grown as the standard hexagonal wurtzite structure with a preferential orientation in the (002) direction. The intensity of the (002) peak decreases for a further extended annealing duration, indicating the greater incorporation of dopants, also confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and low-temperature photoluminescence. Hall and resistivity measurements validate that our¬†ùëùp-type ZnO film has a high carrier concentration of¬†3.73√ó1017‚Äâ‚Äâcm‚àí33.73√ó1017‚Äâ‚Äâcm‚àí3, a high mobility of¬†210‚Äâ‚Äâcm2/Vs210‚Äâ‚Äâcm2/Vs, and a low resistivity of 0.079¬†Œ©cm.

The research on the fabrication of¬†ùëù-ZnO/ùëõ-GaNp-ZnO/n-GaN¬†heterojunctions shown here generates useful advances in the production of cost-effective ZnO-based optoelectronic devices.",

Compared with the nanorod and nanocone arrays, the nanolens array exhibits the highest power conversion efficiency. This result is mainly attributed to the natural capability of the nanolens array to optically couple incident light into in-plane guided modes, which increases the optical path of the incident photons in the long-wavelength regime. The power conversion efficiencies of the optimized nanorod, nanocone, and nanolens arrays are¬†Œ∑‚Äâ=‚Äâ17.4, 18.8, and 22.0%, respectively. These efficiencies correspond to enhancements of 26.1, 36.2, and 59.4% for the nanorod, nanocone, and nanolens arrays, respectively, compared with a planar Si thin-film with a standard quarter-wavelength antireflection layer.

A new approach is proposed to reduce the phase errors, resulting from trigger jitter of the swept source and the asynchronization between the A-scan trigger and OCT signal at the data acquisition end, with a narrowband fiber Bragg grating to generate the accurate A-scan trigger. Furthermore, combining the common-path configuration with the proposed approach, the displacement sensitivity can be calculated to be 80 pm when the swept source is operated at 30 kHz. Finally, the conducting glass was scanned with the proposed approach to quantitatively measure the thickness of conducting layer. The results show that the proposed SS-OCT approach can make be a potentially useful tool for noninvasive, real-time inspection of nanostructures",

        "organization": "Professor of Institute of Electro-Optical Science and Technology  National Taiwan Normal",
        "abstract": "The inspection and measurement of solar cells has become an important technique in evaluating the efficiency and quality of solar cell devices. Currently, surface defect detection of solar cells can be achieved by several approaches such as machine vision, photoluminescence, and electroluminescence imaging techniques. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to inspect the inner structures of solar cells. In response to this need, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have become common techniques for investigating the nanostructures of solar cells. However, both carry the disadvantages of destructive imaging, high cost, and a small inspection area. Moreover, it is difficult to simultaneously estimate multiple optical properties with the aforementioned techniques. In this study, we propose the use of phase-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) for the inspection of solar cells. We develop a two-reference-arm configuration to reduce the phase noise that intrinsically accompanies the OCT system. Based on the proposed approach to extract the amplitude and phase terms from OCT interference signals, the 3D microstructure of solar cells can be obtained while simultaneously probing the nanostructures on arbitrary planes of the solar cell. The OCT microstructural results show that the structures of different layers can be nondestructively visualized and quantitatively evaluated. From the phase signal, the inverted pyramid structure, which is commonly used for the reduction of interface reflection, can be visualized. Moreover, based on the two-reference-arm configuration, the optical reflection coefficient (ORC) can be estimated in order to evaluate the interface reflection from the surface of solar cell. Results show that PS-OCT can be a valuable tool for providing nondestructive inspection of the micro/nanostructures of solar cells.",

From a combination of photoluminescence, reflectance, and excitation power-dependence measurements, we show that the enhanced emission is due mainly to modification of the extraction efficiency, and not to that of the internal efficiency. Furthermore, we show that the extraction enhancement originates from the randomness of the 2D array that scatters light efficiently into the air and the smallness of the nanorods that eliminates the guiding modes that trap light.",

        "abstract": "We present experimental results on the improved performance and high stable temperature characteristics of the InGaN green light-emitting diode (LED) with pre-trimethlyindium (pre-TMIn) flow treatment. By using pre-TMIn flow treatment, a relatively large radiative coefficient (¬†B¬†= 3.34√ó10¬†-11¬†cm¬†3¬†¬∑s¬†-1¬†) corresponding to a 9.2% enhancement in the internal quantum efficiency, as well as a significant reduction of leakage paths for injected carriers, was obtained. Most important, the pre-TMIn flow treatment evidently reduces the dependence of the external quantum efficiency on temperature and efficiency droop of green LEDs. The improvement is thought to be attributable to the preferential formation of In-rich dots upon pre-TMIn flow treatment, which effectively suppresses the trapping of excitons by threading dislocations and the overflowing of injected carriers outside the active regions at elevated temperatures",

We report a giant enhancement of light harvesting based on the integration of different concepts to manipulate the cathode and anode interlayers in an inverted ITO/ZnO-nanorod/poly(3-hexythiophene):(6,6)-phenyl C61¬†butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/Ag cell structure. A layer of conjugated small molecules is self-assembled on the front cathode interlayer while gold nanoparticles are doped into the rear anode interlayer. The former one carries the characteristic of surface passivation and the latter one has the unique property of localized surface plasmon effect. Quite interestingly, both approaches can effectively enhance the exciton dissociation rate and extend the carrier lifetime. Through the integrated approaches in a single cell, by taking the advantage of each individual contribution and the coupling effect between them, the efficiency can be further boosted from 2.02% to 4.36%, which sets the record for the inverted polymer solar cell using ZnO-nanorod as electron transporting layer and P3HT:PCBM as photoactive layer so far.",

        "organization": "Professor of Institute of Electro-Optical Science and Technology  National Taiwan Normal",
        "abstract": "We investigate the mechanism responding for performance enhancement of gallium nitride (GaN)-based light-emitting diode (LED) grown on chemical wet-etching-patterned sapphire substrate (CWE-PSS) with V-Shaped pit features on the top surface. According to temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) measurement and the measured external quantum efficiency, the structure can simultaneously enhance both internal quantum efficiency and light extraction efficiency. Comparing to devices grown on planar sapphire substrate, the threading dislocation defects of LED grown on CWE-PSS are reduced from 1.28√ó109/cm2√ó109/cm2¬†to 3.62√ó108/cm2√ó108/cm2, leading to a 12.5% enhancement in internal quantum efficiency. In terms of the theoretical computing of radiation patterns, the V-Shaped pits roughening surface can be thought of as a strong diffuser with paraboloidal autocorrelation function, increasing the escape probability of trapped photons and achieving a 20% enhancement in light extraction efficiency. Moreover, according to the measurement of optical diffraction power, CWE-PSS demonstrated superior guided light extraction efficiency than that of planar sapphire substrate, thus an extra 7.8% enhancement in light extraction efficiency was obtained. Therefore, comparing to the conventional LED, an overall 45% enhancement in integrated output power was achieved.",

AZO thin films of¬†c-axis-oriented growth and with different thickness were deposited on PET flexible plastic substrates at room temperature by rf magnetron sputtering. A larger grain size with a decreased strain¬†Œµ¬†value is observed in a thicker film, while changes in composition for films with different thicknesses are insignificant.

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel structure of an AlGaInP light-emitting diode (LED) to extract the waveguided light for high-brightness applications. Four devices are considered and compared. They are AlGaInP-sapphire LEDs with: 1) a planar Ag reflector (LED-A); 2) a patterned Ag reflector (LED-B); 3) a planar Ag reflector and surface-roughened features (LED-C); and 4) a patterned Ag reflector and surface-roughened features (LED-D). The patterned Ag reflector can be used to direct some of the waveguided light that bounces within the AlGaInP LED and sapphire substrate to the top escape cone of the LED surface. Additionally, the roughened features, which are randomly distributed on the LED surface, enable the waveguided light that is trapped inside the LED chip to be coupled efficiently into the air. As a result, the external quantum efficiencies of LED-A, LED-B, LED-C, and LED-D measured at¬†I¬†= 350 mA are Œ∑ = 9.20%, 10.46%, 15.22%, and 16.75%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "ZnO nanorods (NRs) and Ag nanoparticles (NPs) are known to enhance the luminescence of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) through the high directionality of waveguide mode transmission and efficient energy transfer of localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonances, respectively. In this work, we have demonstrated Ag NP-incorporated n-ZnO NRs/p-GaN heterojunctions by facilely hydrothermally growing ZnO NRs on Ag NP-covered GaN, in which the Ag NPs were introduced and randomly distributed on the p-GaN surface to excite the LSP resonances. Compared with the reference LED, the light-output power of the near-band-edge (NBE) emission (ZnO,¬†Œª¬†= 380 nm) of our hybridized structure is increased almost 1.5‚Äì2 times and can be further modified in a controlled manner by varying the surface morphology of the surrounding medium of the Ag NPs. The improved light-output power is mainly attributed to the LSP resonance between the NBE emission of ZnO NRs and LSPs in Ag NPs. We also observed different behaviors in the electroluminescence (EL) spectra as the injection current increases for the treatment and reference LEDs. This observation might be attributed to the modification of the energy band diagram for introducing Ag NPs at the interface between n-ZnO NRs and p-GaN. Our results pave the way for developing advanced nanostructured LED devices with high luminescence efficiency in the UV emission regime.",

        "organization": "Professor of Institute of Electro-Optical Science and Technology  National Taiwan Normal",
        "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for noninvasive, real-time oral cancer diagnosis. However, in previous reports, OCT has still been found to be difficult to use in the diagnosis of oral precancerous stages, including mild dysplasia and moderate dysplasia. In clinical applications, early diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer can greatly improve the survival rate. Therefore, in this study, we propose a new approach to differentiate the oral precancerous stages based on the evaluation of the optical scattering properties of the epithelial layer, which is where the dysplastic cells start to develop in the precancerous stages. Instead of using exponential decay fitting to evaluate the scattering properties of mucosal tissues based on the Beer‚ÄìLambert law, linear fitting of the OCT depth intensity is used to evaluate the scattering properties of normal and dysplastic cells. From the statistical results of the linear fitting, the slope,¬†a, can be an effective indicator to discriminate healthy mucosa and moderate dysplasia when an¬†a¬†value equal to zero is the threshold value, and the intercept,¬†b, can be used to differentiate healthy and dysplastic mucosae, as well as mild and moderate dysplasia, when¬†b¬†values of 0.15 and 0.18 are used as the threshold values, respectively. Furthermore, this approach is also applied to the determination of the safe margin between normal and abnormal mucosae, making it possible to provide real-time,¬†in vivo¬†inspection during oral maxillofacial surgery.",

        "organization": "Professor of Institute of Electro-Optical Science and Technology  National Taiwan Normal",
        "abstract": "One of the most challenging issues when operating a high-power light-emitting diode (LED) is to conduct appropriate packaging materials for the reliable thermal management of the entire device. Generally, the considerable amount of heat produced around the junction area of the LED would transfers to the entire device, and causes thermal expansion in the packaging material. It induces strain inevitably, and hinders the output performances and possible applications of high-power LEDs. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) is a physical quantity that indicates the expansion to which value a material will be upon heating. Therefore, as far as an advancement of thermal management is concerned, the quantitative and real-time determination of CTE of packaging materials becomes more important than ever since the demanding of high-power LEDs is increased in recent years. In this study, we measure the CTE of GaN-based (Œª¬†=¬†450¬†nm) high-power LED encapsulated with polystyrene resin by using optical coherent tomography (OCT). The displacement change between individual junctions of OCT image is directly observed and recorded to derive the CTE values of composed components of the LED device. The obtained instant CTE of polystyrene resin is estimated to be around 10¬†√ó¬†10‚àí5/¬∞C, which is a spatial average value over the OCT scanning area of 10¬†Œºm¬†√ó¬†10¬†Œºm. The OCT provides an alternative way to determine a real-time, non-destructive, and spatially resolved CTE values of the LED device, and that shows essential advantage over the typical CTE measurement techniques.",

        "organization": "Professor of Institute of Electro-Optical Science and Technology  National Taiwan Normal",
        "abstract": "The application of random lasers has been restricted due to the absence of a well-defined resonant cavity, as the lasing action mainly depends on multiple light scattering induced by intrinsic disorders of the laser medium to establish the required optical feedback that hence increases the difficulty in efficiently tuning and modulating random lasing emissions. This study investigated whether the transport mean free path of emitted photons within disordered scatterers composed of ZnO nanowires is tunable by a curvature bending applied to the flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate underneath, thereby creating a unique light source that can be operated above and below the lasing threshold for desirable spectral emissions. For the first time, the developed curvature-tunable random laser is implemented for¬†in vivo¬†biological imaging with much lower speckle noise compared to the non-lasing situation through simple mechanical bending, which is of great potential for studying the fast-moving physiological phenomenon such as blood flow patterns in mouse ear skin. It is expected that the experimental demonstration of the curvature-tunable random laser can provide a new route to develop disorder-based optoelectronic devices.",

        "organization": "Professor of Institute of Electro-Optical Science and Technology  National Taiwan Normal",
        "abstract": "The mechanisms of the excitation power dependent internal quantum efficiency in InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells (MQWs) LEDs grown on the planar and the patterned sapphire substrates (PSS) at temperature of 15 and 300 K were investigated. From observation the tendency of emission peak energy and carrier lifetime variation in MQWs with different excitation power for both LED samples, we conclude the internal quantum efficiency would increase as coulomb screening effect dominates at lower carrier injection stage and decrease due to the band-filling effect at higher density stage. At room temperature, the majority of the initial injected carriers would be first consumed by the thermal activated nonradiative centers that hinder the further achievement of high-efficiency LED devices. Experimentally, the internal quantum efficiency of the LED grown on the PSS is ~70% and that of the LED grown on the planar sapphire substrate is ~62%. For the LED grown on the PSS, the observed higher internal quantum efficiency is due to the larger activation energy Therefore, the reduction of dislocation defects and the prevention of injected carriers escaping from extended states would be a promising prospective for InGaN/GaN MQWs LEDs to achieve high internal quantum efficiency.¬†",

        "abstract": "Fractional photothermolysis induced by non-ablative fractional lasers (NAFLs) or ablative fractional lasers (AFLs) can remodel the skin, regenerate collagen, and remove tumor tissue. However, fractional laser treatments may result in severe side effects, and multiple treatments are required to achieve the expected outcome. Thus, the treatment outcome and downtime after fractional laser treatments are key issues to determine the following treatment strategy. In this study, an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system was implemented for¬†in vivo¬†studies of wound healing after NAFL and AFL treatments. According to the OCT scanning results, the laser-induced photothermolysis including volatilization and coagulation could be morphologically identified. To continue monitoring the wound healing process, the treated regions were scanned with OCT at different time points, and the en-face images at various tissue depths were extracted from three-dimensional OCT images. Furthermore, to quantitatively evaluate the morphological changes at different tissue depths during wound healing, an algorithm was developed to distinguish the backscattering properties of untreated and treated tissues. The results showed that the coagulation damage induced by the NAFLs could be rapidly healed in 6 days. In contrast, the tissue volatilization induced by AFLs required a longer recovery time of 14 days. In conclusion, this study establishes the feasibility of this methodology as a means of clinically monitoring treatment outcomes and wound healing after fractional laser treatments.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate high performance of antireflection (AR) coating composed of the¬†ZnO¬†nanorods¬†(NRs) and TiO2¬†layers applied on InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cells. The high performance of this AR coating is due to the realization of a smooth gradient profile of¬†refractive index¬†fabricated by only two physical layers. First, due to the inherent inhomogeneous-nanoporous geometry along the surface normal, the ZnO NRs are reasonable to be considered as discrete multiple¬†optical layers¬†with low scattering loss, leading to the index smoothly increasing from air ambient toward down to the solar cells. Second, to compensate the gap of index between ZnO and solar cells, an additional TiO2¬†layer with index in between is hence necessary to insert under ZnO NRs, significantly further reducing the Fresnel reflection loss of the entire device. The ZnO NRs/ TiO2¬†layer shows a low wavelength-averaged (solar spectrum weighted)¬†reflectance¬†of 6.00% (4.78%) over a wide¬†spectral range¬†of¬†Œª=380‚Äì1800¬†nm, and exhibits a¬†hydrophobic surface¬†with a water contact angle of 128.2¬∞. At device level, we compared the¬†photovoltaic performance¬†of solar cells with and without AR coating, the short-circuit density (JSC) is enhanced by 31.8% and 23.8% for solar cells integrated with the ZnO NRs/TiO2¬†layer and conventional SiO2/TiO2¬†double-layer AR (DLAR) coating, respectively. Under a very large incident angle of solar¬†illumination¬†(Œ∏=80¬∞), the ZnO NRs/TiO2¬†layer remains static with¬†JSC¬†enhancement of 35.2%, whereas the¬†JSC¬†enhancement of conventional DLAR coating drops down to 9.4%. In addition, the ZnO NRs/TiO2¬†layer barely affects the open-circuit voltage and fill factor of the solar device. Therefore, the proposed ZnO NRs/TiO2¬†layer with a smoother graded refractive index change is highly promising for the AR¬†coating applications¬†for the next-generation solar cells.",

        "abstract": "This study demonstrates the capability of controlling optical anisotropy of lasing emissions by manipulating the coupling strength spatially and spectrally between the oscillated electric field of emitted light and the localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonance for a random lasing medium composed of colloidal CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) and ellipsoidal silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). Distinctive from the amplified spontaneous emission generally observed on colloidal CdSe/ZnS QDs, it has been found that lasing emissions of the revealed system exhibit clear interference features (coherent optical feedbacks) with low‚Äêthreshold characteristics, mainly attributed to enhanced light scatterings and optical gains arisen in peripheral surfaces of ellipsoidal Ag NPs. Importantly, the relative orientation, between the oscillated electric field of emitted light from colloidal CdSe/ZnS QDs and the ellipse axis of Ag NPs, plays a critical role in selective excitation of LSP resonances leading to laser emissions with preferential optical polarizations. The achievement of spatial and spectral coupling of LSP resonance with colloidal QDs, respectively, by spin coating thin QDs film on Ag NPs and control of the Ag NP geometry makes the present system one of the promising candidates of colloidal QDs‚Äêbased random lasers to achieve coherent and polarized lasing emissions.",

For the LED sample with a pre-TMIn flow treatment, the tunnelling of injected carriers associated with threading defects is significantly reduced, which promotes the diffusion‚Äìrecombination of injected carriers, as well as the overall emission efficiency of the LED. In addition, the pre-TMIn flow treatment evidently reduces the dependence of external quantum efficiency on temperature and efficiency droop of green LEDs.

        "abstract": "Recently, the control of correlated color temperature (CCT) of artificial solid-state white-light sources starts to attract more attention since CTs affect human physiology and health profoundly. In this work, we proposed and demonstrated a method that can widely tune the CCTs of electroluminescence (EL) from white-light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) by employing plasmonic filters. These integrated on-chip plasmonic filters are composed of semicontinuous thin Ag film or Ag nanoparticles (NPs) both included in the indium tin oxide anode contact, which have different characteristics of plasmonic resonant absorptions that can tune the EL spectra of white LECs. The CCTs of EL from white LECs integrated with semicontinuous thin Ag film and randomly distributed Ag NPs are 5778 and 2350 K, respectively. A commercially available laser scanning system was used to locally thermal anneal the semicontinuous thin Ag film to form the randomly distributed Ag NPs on the scanned areas. Hence, these two kinds of filters can be integrated on the same chip of white LEC, giving more freedom to control the CCTs of white EL and more potential applications. In addition, the laser scanning system used here is quite often used in display manufactures so that our proposed method can be immediately adopted by the light-emitting diode industry.",

Enhanced light-output power and external quantum efficiency are observed and the amount of enhancement remains steady with the increase of the injected currents. To understand the observations theoretically, the absorption spectra and the electric field distributions of the VLED with and without Ag NPs decorated on ZnO NRs are determined using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The results prove that the observation of enhancement of the external quantum efficiency can be attributed to the creation of an extra escape channel for trapped light due to the coupling of the LSP with wave-guided mode light, by which the energy of wave-guided mode light can be transferred to the efficient light scattering center of the LSP.",

The presented scheme increases the internal quantum efficiency by 45.5% at I=20¬†mA and 55.7% at I=100¬†mA, indicating a considerable reduction of efficiency-droop. This improvement is attributable mainly to the use of the gradual InGaN QW's structure that significantly alleviates band bending in the valence band, improving the transport efficiency of injected holes above that of conventional LEDs. The radiative recombination is thus enhanced as the overlap between electron and hole wave functions is increased. Most importantly, the leakage of injected electrons to p-type region is correspondingly reduced, in turn suppressing the efficiency-droop in the LED",

        "abstract": "An n-side-up AlGaInP-based LED operating at a wavelength of 630 nm with a stripe-patterned omni-directional reflector (ODR) was fabricated by adopting the adhesive-layer bonding scheme. It is demonstrated that the periodic and geometrical shape of the stripe-patterned array improves the light extraction efficiency by increasing the extraction of guided light. Compared to the conventional ODR LED, the stripe-patterned ODR LED significantly enhanced the output power and with only a slightly higher forward voltage. This improvement was analysed by the scanning near-field optical microscope (SNOM) and the optimized dimension of stripe patterns was also calculated on the basis of a Monte Carlo ray tracing simulation. According to the above analysis, the increase of light extraction could not only be attributed to the geometrical shape of the stripe patterns that redirect the trapped light towards the top-escaping cone of the LED surface but also to the repetitive stripe-patterned array of diffracting elements that effectively diffract the guided light outside the LED surface. Moreover, the optimized dimension of the stripe pattern is 3 ¬µm wide, 2 ¬µm deep and spaced 3 ¬µm apart, which coincides with experimental results.",

        "abstract": "Staggered quantum wells (QWs) structures are numerically studied to reduce the influence of efficiency-droop effect on the InGaN-based green light-emitting diode (LED). The location of high In-content InGaN layer in staggered QWs considerably affects the distribution of the electrostatic-field of an LED. When the high In-content InGaN layer is suitably located in the staggered QWs, the localized electrostatic-field with high intensity increases the transport efficiency of injected holes across the active region, improving the overall radiative efficiency of the LED. Most importantly, as accumulation of injected holes in the last QW is relieved, the Auger recombination process is quenched, suppressing the efficiency-droop in the LED. Theoretically, the incorporation of the staggered InGaN QWs in the green LED (Œª¬†= 530 nm) can ensure an extremely low efficiency droop of 11.3%.",

These two kinds of n-ZnO/p-GaN heterojunctions were then fabricated the light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The electrical and optical properties of these two kinds of LEDs were investigated systematically. The results show that the slanted n-ZnO/p-GaN LEDs have a lower turn-on voltage and less leakage current than that of planar n-ZnO/p-GaN LEDs. Moreover, different from the planar n-ZnO/p-GaN LEDs which emitting colors changes with injection current, the slanted n-ZnO/p-GaN LEDs retains UV emissions (385-400 nm) under the entire range of injection currents we applied. The dominant UV luminescence of slanted n-ZnO/p-GaN LEDs is attributed to the ZnO near band edge transitions, indicating the high quality of slanted ZnO films and exhibiting the essential property dedicated to nano-sized heterojunctions. Hence, we have demonstrated that the slanted n-ZnO/p-GaN LEDs fabricated by oblique angle deposition have better performance than the planar n-ZnO/p-GaN LEDs fabricated by convention deposition means.",

        "abstract": "High light-extraction (external quantum efficiency ~40%) 465-nm GaN-based vertical light-emitting diodes (LEDs) employing double diffuse surfaces were fabricated. This novel LED structure includes one top transmitted diffuse surface and another diffuse omnidirectional reflector (ODR) on the bottom of a LED chip. The diffusive ODR consists of a roughened p-type GaN layer, an indium-tin-oxide (ITO) low refractive index layer, and an Al layer. The surface of the p-type GaN-layer was naturally roughened while decreasing the growth temperature to 800 degC. After flip-bonding onto a Si substrate by AuSn eutectic metal and laser lift-off processes to remove the sapphire substrate, an anisotropic etching by dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) was employed on the N-face n-GaN layer to obtain transmitted diffuse surfaces with hexagonal-cone morphology. The double diffused surfaces LEDs show an enhancement of 56% and 236% in light output power compared to single side diffused surface and conventional LEDs, respectively. The devices also show a low leakage current in the order of magnitude of 10¬†-8¬†A at -5 V and a calculated external quantum efficiency of about 40%. The high scattering efficiency of double diffused surfaces could be responsible for the enhancement in the device light output power",

        "organization": "Professor of Institute of Electro-Optical Science and Technology  National Taiwan Normal",
        "abstract": "In this study, we experimentally demonstrated a flexible random laser fabricated on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate with a high degree of tunability in lasing emissions. Random lasing oscillation arises mainly from the resonance coupling between the emitted photons of gain medium (Rhodamine 6G, R6G) and the localized surface plasmon (LSP) of silver nanoprisms (Ag NPRs), which increases the effective cross-section for multiple light scattering, thus stimulating the lasing emissions. More importantly, it was found that the random lasing wavelength is blue-shifted monolithically with the increase in bending strains exerted on the PET substrate, and a maximum shift of ‚àº15 nm was achieved in the lasing wavelength, when a 50% bending strain was exerted on the PET substrate. Such observation is highly repeatable and reversible, and this validates that we can control the lasing wavelength by simply bending the flexible substrate decorated with the Ag NPRs. The scattering spectrum of the Ag NPRs was obtained using a dark-field microscope to understand the mechanism for the dependence of the wavelength shift on the exerted bending strains. As a result, we believe that the experimental demonstration of tunable lasing emissions based on the revealed structure is expected to open up a new application field of random lasers.",

        "abstract": "Blood coagulation is the clotting and subsequent dissolution of the clot following repair to the damaged tissue. However, inducing blood coagulation is difficult for some patients with homeostasis dysfunction or during surgery. In this study, we proposed a method to develop an integrated system that combines optical coherence tomography (OCT) and laser microsurgery for blood coagulation. Also, an algorithm for positioning of the treatment location from OCT images was developed. With OCT scanning, 2D/3D OCT images and angiography of tissue can be obtained simultaneously, enabling to noninvasively reconstruct the morphological and microvascular structures for real-time monitoring of changes in biological tissues during laser microsurgery. Instead of high-cost pulsed lasers, continuous-wave laser diodes (CW-LDs) with the central wavelengths of 450‚Äânm and 532‚Äânm are used for blood coagulation, corresponding to higher absorption coefficients of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. Experimental results showed that the location of laser exposure can be accurately controlled with the proposed approach of imaging-based feedback positioning. Moreover, blood coagulation can be efficiently induced by CW-LDs and the coagulation process can be monitored in real-time with OCT. This technology enables to potentially provide accurate positioning for laser microsurgery and control the laser exposure to avoid extra damage by real-time OCT imaging.",

        "abstract": "A III-V multi-junction tandem solar cell is the most efficient photovoltaic structure that offers an extremely high power conversion efficiency. Current mismatching between each subcell of the device, however, is a significant challenge that causes the experimental value of the power conversion efficiency to deviate from the theoretical value. In this work, we explore a promising strategy using CdSe quantum dots (QDs) to enhance the photocurrent of the limited subcell to match with those of the other subcells and to enhance the power conversion efficiency of InGaP/GaAs/Ge tandem solar cells. The underlying mechanism of the enhancement can be attributed to the QD‚Äôs unique capacity for photon conversion that tailors the incident spectrum of solar light; the enhanced efficiency of the device is therefore strongly dependent on the QD‚Äôs dimensions. As a result, by appropriately selecting and spreading 7 mg/mL of CdSe QDs with diameters of 4.2 nm upon the InGaP/GaAs/Ge solar cell, the power conversion efficiency shows an enhancement of 10.39% compared to the cell‚Äôs counterpart without integrating CdSe QDs.",

The PL emission peak of the MQWs active layer has a blue-shift phenomenon that is caused by a partial reduction of the strain on the InGaN well.

In this study, we used optical coherence tomography (OCT) to measure the CTE of an InGaN-based (Œª = 450 nm) high-power LED encapsulated in polystyrene resin. The distances between individual interfaces of the OCT images were observed and recorded to derive the instantaneous CTE of the packaged LED under different injected currents. The LED junction temperature at different injected currents was established with the forward voltage method. Most importantly, this work validates the hypothesis that OCT can provide an alternative way to directly and nondestructively determine the spatially resolved CTE of the packaged LED device, which offers significant advantages over traditional CTE measurement techniques.",

        "abstract": "A chemical wet etching technique is presented to form a nano-roughened surface with triangle-like morphology on n-side-up AlGaInP-based LEDs fabricated by adopting adhesive layer bonding scheme. A simple and commonly used H3PO4-based solution was applied for chemical wet etching. The morphology of nano-roughened surfaces is analyzed by the atomic force microscope (AFM) and significantly related to the enhancement factor of the LED output power. The output power shows 80% increase after optimizing the nano-roughened morphology of n-side surface, as compared to the ordinary flat surface LED.",
