        "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that can negatively affect a patient's quality of life (QoL), often hindering social functioning. ISA247, a novel psoriatic agent, has shown clinical efficacy in moderate to severe psoriasis sufferers, but its effect on QoL is currently not reported. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of ISA247 on the QoL in patients with stable, plaque-type psoriasis. A phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study assessed the effects of ISA247 doses of 0.5 mg/kg/d (n = 77) or 1.5 mg/kg/d (n = 83) compared with placebo (n = 41) for 12 weeks. QoL was assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI) scales. ISA247 treatment (pooled groups) significantly improved QoL scores as assessed by both the DLQI and the PDI compared with those receiving placebo (p < .05). Treatment with the higher dose of 1.5 mg/kg/d demonstrated a significantly greater response to many of the QoL scales compared with the 0.5 mg/kg/d group (p < .05). ISA247 appears to improve the QoL while also providing effective treatment for chronic, moderate to severe, plaque-type psoriasis.",

        "abstract": "Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is often poorly responsive to 2nd line antirheumatic drug therapy. Sulfasalazine has recently gained wide acceptance in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and beneficial effects have also been noted in ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis. We report a double blind placebo controlled study of sulfasalazine in PsA. METHODS: Twenty-four patients with active PsA were randomized to receive either sulfasalazine (3 g/day) (n = 10) or placebo (n = 14) for 8 weeks, in a double blind manner, followed by an 8 week open label crossover phase for nonresponding placebo patients. RESULTS: Compared with placebo controls, sulfasalazine treated patients were significantly improved at Weeks 4 and 8 with respect to physician (p < 0.01) and patient (p < 0.05) global assessments. Duration of morning stiffness was significantly decreased at Week 8 (p < 0.01). Clinical variables of disease activity returned to baseline after a 4 week drug washout period in 5 evaluable patients. Six patients in the placebo group crossed over to an 8 week open label phase and demonstrated significant improvements in joint scores, 50 ft walking time, and global patient assessment. Sulfasalazine treated patients also showed significant improvements in cutaneous involvement. CONCLUSION: Sulfasalazine was effective in PsA, with efficacy observed as early as the 4th week of treatment. Longterm studies are needed to determine whether such therapy can modify disease outcome.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Because of the ubiquitous nature of dermatophytes and a lack of an adaptive immune response in the nail plate, recurrence and relapse rates associated with superficial fungal infections are high (10%–53%). Cured or improved dermatophytosis patients could become reinfected if exposed to fungal reservoirs, such as an infected shoe, sock, or textile. To prevent this, footwear, sock, and textile sanitization methods can be used. To provide insight into effective sanitization options, the focus of this article is to review footwear, sock, and textile sanitization studies conducted throughout history (1920–2016). Thirty-three studies are covered in this review, encompassing techniques ranging from formaldehyde fumigation and foot powder application, to more modern approaches such as UV light and silver-light irradiation technologies. Older sanitization methods (eg, boiling, use of chlorine and salts) are quite limited in their practicality, as they can result in health complications and ruin shoe integrity. Newer approaches to shoe and sock sanitization, such as ozone application and UV irradiation, have shown very promising results. Further research is still needed with these modern techniques, as knowledge gaps and cost prevent the creation of standardized parameters for successful use. By combining sanitization methods with other preventative measures, protection against reinfection may be enhanced.",

In the disk diffusion assay terbinafine produced the largest inhibition zone diameters (IZDs) on Dermasel agar media followed by ravuconazole, griseofulvin, posaconazole, and itraconazole. A significant correlation was not observed between the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and IZDs, but some correlations were observed for POS, RAV, and TER (correlation coefficients r=−0.507, −0.249, −0.267, P<0.05, respectively). MICs obtained by the microdilution method with ITR and GRE did not correlate with IZDs obtained in disk diffusion assays in this study. The ciclopirox (20 µg/disk) and fluconazole (25 µg/disk) did not produce well defined inhibition zone diameters on Dermasel agar medium.",

        "abstract": "Onychomycosis is a relatively common condition the aetiology of which appears to be multifactorial, with both genetic and acquired factors being responsible. In our clinical practice we have observed that smokers and individuals with peripheral arterial disease may have an increased prevalence of onychomycosis compared to normal individuals. Patients attending a vascular clinic in a hospital were asked about a history of smoking and peripheral arterial disease. The lower extremity was assessed for peripheral arterial disease. Material was obtained from toenails for mycological evaluation. Two hundred and fifty‐four patients (male 146, female 108; age, mean ± standard error, 66.6 ± 0.8 years) were enrolled. Abnormal‐appearing nails and onychomycosis were present in 49.2% and 22.4% of patients, respectively. Factors associated with onychomycosis included, increasing age (risk odds ratio [ROR] 1.05, P  = 0.002), male gender (ROR 1.7, P  = 0.09), smoking (packs per day) (ROR 1.9, P  = 0.02) and peripheral arterial disease (ROR 4.8, P  = 0.02). The factors predisposing to the development of onychomycosis are multifactorial. Both smoking (number of packs of cigarettes consumed per day) and peripheral arterial disease are independent predictors of onychomycosis. Awareness of these factors may help in the prevention of onychomycosis and the optimal management of this disease.",

        "abstract": "Onychomycosis accounts for 50% of all nail disease cases and is commonly caused by dermatophytes. Diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus, immunosuppression, obesity, smoking, and advancing age are predisposing factors of this fungal infection. Potassium hydroxide and culture are considered the current standard for diagnosing onychomycosis, revealing both fungal viability and species identification. Other diagnostic tests currently available include periodic acid–Schiff staining, polymerase chain reaction techniques, and fluorescent staining. Across 6 recently published epidemiology studies, the global prevalence of onychomycosis was estimated to be 5.5%, falling within the range of previously reported estimates (2%-8%). Newly approved onychomycosis treatments include efinaconazole, tavaborole, and laser therapy with lasers only approved to temporarily increase the amount of clear nail. Additional onychomycosis treatments being investigated include iontophoresis and photodynamic therapy with small open-label studies reported thus far. Preventative strategies, to help decrease recurrence and reinfection rates, include sanitisation of footwear and prophylactic topical antifungal agents.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is characterized by non-scarring follicle miniaturization. Despite the success of approved therapies, commonly reported side effects and the need for continual use has led to the investigation of alternative therapies. The aim of this paper is to critically review the success of off-label, topical monotherapies for treatment of AGA in men. A literature search was conducted to obtain randomized, controlled and blinded studies that investigated off-label, topical, monotherapies in male patients. Hair density, hair diameter and hair growth were used to evaluate treatment success. Fourteen off-label topical therapies were investigated among the 16 studies that met inclusion criteria. Nine off-label therapies were reported to produce a significantly greater improvement in hair restoration parameters (e.g. mean change from hair count and hair diameter) as compared to placebo (p < 0.05 for all treatments). In two studies, procyanidin oligomers exhibited greater efficacy over vehicle with response to mean change in hair density (hairs/cm2) (ps < 0.0001 at Week 24). In conclusion, prostaglandin analogs and polyphenols, such as latanoprost and procyanidin oligomers, can improve hair restoration parameters in male AGA patients, possibly through targeting mechanisms proposed in the etiology of AGA. The current evidence suggests short-term (24 weeks) use may provide benefit for hair loss patients; however, long-term efficacy and safety data are required.",

Yet psoriasis has received little attention in the recent psychiatric literature. A subgroup of psoriatics appear to be “stress reactors” and these patients may have a better long-term prognosis. Identification of such patients early in the course of treatment and incorporation of specific psychosocial interventions in their overall treatment regimen may improve the course of illness. Psoriasis has also been associated with suicide and an increased prevalence of alcoholism. The disturbances in body image perception and the effect of psoriasis on interpersonal, social, and occupational functioning can further contribute to the overall morbidity, especially if psoriasis first occurs during a developmentally critical period like adolescence. Certain biochemical and physiologic correlates of psoriasis of interest to the psychiatrist such as exacerbation of psoriasis with lithium therapy and increased cutaneous blood flow are discussed. Finally, some practical guidelines are provided for psychosocial interventions in psoriasis.",

Tavaborole was applied to human fingernails painted with 2 or 4 coats of nail polish, and unpainted nails in an ex vivo model. Nails were mounted on TurChub® chambers seeded with Trichophyton rubrum and allowed to incubate for 7 days. Antifungal activity was assessed by measuring zones of inhibition. Tavaborole exhibited antifungal activity in all experimental groups. The zones of inhibition of T. rubrum for all experimental groups (2 or 4 coats of polish, unpolished) were greater than infected controls (polished and unpolished), ps < .001.

These disorders may be associated with serious sequelae, such as suicide and repeated major surgical procedures. Their treatment is also primarily psychiatric. This article critically reviews the literature and comments upon the salient clinical features and treatments for these disorders, which are relevant for the psychiatrist doing consultation-liaison work. Knowledge of these disorders is important in the evaluation of any psychiatric patient, as these disorders are essentially a cutaneous sign of psychopathology.",

We tested the hypothesis that women with anorexia nervosa and/or bulimia nervosa (N = 59), conditions associated with body image problems, report a greater deprivation of tactile nurturance than a sample of non-clinical randomly selected women (N = 140) from the community. Measures of body image included the Drive for Thinness and Body Dissatisfaction subscales of the Eating Disorder Inventory. Perceived touch deprivation was rated on a 10-point scale, previously developed by the author. Analysis of covariance, controlling for the effects of age and body mass index, revealed that the eating disorder group reported greater (p < 0.0001) body image concerns and perceived greater (p < 0.0001) touch deprivation both during their childhood and their current life, than the non-clinical group.

        "abstract": "Dissociation and conversion (defined as the somatic component of dissociation) can play an important mediating role in the exacerbation of the stress-reactive dermatoses (eg, psoriasis, idiopathic urticaria, atopic dermatitis), dermatoses that are exacerbated by excessive scratching (eg, lichen simplex chronicus, prurigo nodularis) and koebnerization, and the self-induced dermatoses (dermatitis artefacta, acne excoriée, skin picking disorder, trichotillomania, onychotillomania/onychophagia). Dissociative symptoms often coexist with obsessive-compulsive symptoms in the more severe cases of the self-induced dermatoses. Dissociation can play an important role in cutaneous sensory disorder (eg, scalp dysesthesia syndrome, stomatodynia/glossodynia, vulvodynia/scrotodynia, medically unexplained anesthesia). Dissociation typically occurs in the context of extreme psychosocial stress and a history of severe abuse/neglect during early life. Dissociative patients may experience a sense of detachment from their body and present in a state of extreme self-neglect, including denial of serious skin disorders. Amnesia is one of the core symptoms of dissociation; therefore, patients, who self-induce their skin lesions during a dissociative episode often deny self-inducing their lesions; it is important to recognize that this is distinct from malingering, and the lesions are not intentionally induced. Dissociation and conversion symptoms are typically present in the complex dermatology patient and should be assessed using a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach.",

        "abstract": "Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is currently in use to stimulate hair growth and is quickly gaining in popularity due to the ease of use and absence of side effects. In 2015 alone, the number of LLLT devices with the Food and Drug Administration clearance has doubled. To consolidate evidence and establish which data are still required for the widespread acceptance of LLLT for hair loss therapy. A thorough search of the PubMed database was conducted to obtain studies investigating LLLT for androgenetic alopecia in men and women. Nine trials were identified for comb and helmet/cap devices, five of which were randomized controlled trials. Data comparison across LLLT trials and with traditional hair loss therapy (minoxidil, finasteride) was not straight forward because there was a lack of visual evidence, sample sizes were low, and there were large variations in study duration and efficacy measurements. There are a number of unanswered questions about the optimum treatment regimen, including maintenance treatment and the long-term consequences of LLLT use. Moving forward, protocols should be standardized across trials. Moreover, it is recommended that future trials include visual evidence and trial duration be expanded to 12 months.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "The contribution of psychosomatic factors toward the morbidity associated with psoriasis should be evaluated in the context of the patient's developmental stage and life situation. The skin, as a sensory organ, plays a critical role in an individual's physical and emotional growth in early life. The skin also plays an integral role as an organ of communication throughout life and greatly affects an individual's body image and self-esteem. If these factors are not taken into consideration, the morbidity associated with psoriasis may increase, or the patient may remain dissatisfied with treatment even in the face of clinically satisfactory treatment outcome. Some recent studies indicate that the adverse impace of psoriasis upon the quality of life can result in significant chronic stress, which may in turn exacerbate the psoriasis in a subgroup of patients. As disease-related stress is present in every patient to some degree, the dermatologist should regularly assess the psychosocial impact of the disease. Certain personality factors, such as a tendency to want the approval of others and difficulty with assertion of angry feelings, may make the patient with psoriasis more vulnerable to stress and contribute toward the stress reactivity of the disease. The presence of depression in psoriasis may modulate itch perception, exacerbate pruritus, and lead to difficulties with initiating and maintaining sleep. Helping the patient to develop assertiveness skills in addition to supportive psychotherapy may facilitate the patient's capacity to cope with the daily stresses associated with psoriasis. Treatment of depressive symptoms may prove to be a helpful adjunct in the management of pruritus and sleep difficulties in psoriasis.",

Histologic examination and DNA analysis (performed in two cases) revealed benign dermal lymphocytic infiltrates. In two cases proliferation of only T cells occurred. In the third case, both T and B cell populations were expanded and there was vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer of the epidermis and IgG, IgM, and C3 deposition along the dermoepidermal junction. These findings may be the result of cyclosporine-induced immune dysregulation. The lesions resolved in all patients after therapy was stopped.",

        "abstract": "Onychomycosis is a difficult-to-treat chronic fungal infection of the nail. The chronic nature of onychomycosis, with relevance to current treatment practices, could be attributed to host anergy, development of increased virulence in causal agents (multidrug resistance efflux pump), and biofilms. Biofilms must be disrupted prior to antifungal treatment suggesting the necessity of combination treatment. Once the biofilm has been disrupted, further techniques in addition to antifungal usage are suggested to ensure a positive prognosis including use of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy or low-frequency surface acoustic waves. Overall, with continued success in developing antibiofilm treatment for bacterial and yeast pathogens, therapy can be more quickly expanded to dermatophytes. With a rise in predisposing factors, it is important to preemptively address treatment for this disease with continued investigation into antibiofilm therapy including optimal treatment combinations and dosages targeted specifically at dermatophytes.",

Suicide risk must be assessed within a demographic context because suicide rates rise rapidly in adolescents and young adults, among whom the prevalence of skin disorders associated with suicidal behaviors (acne, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis) is also high, and suicide rates are increasing among white men, who tend to be overrepresented in dermatology clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy is a novel procedure used to treat androgenetic alopecia (AGA). Propose a mechanism of action of PRP therapy for AGA. A thorough literature search including PRP research for AGA therapy as well as PRP research in other areas of medicine was conducted. A mechanistic model for the action of PRP on the hair follicle was created. Platelet-rich plasma therapy stimulates hair growth through the promotion of vascularization and angiogenesis, as well as encourages hair follicles to enter and extend the duration of the anagen phase of the growth cycle. The process is accomplished through growth factor-mediated increased activation of wingless (Wnt)/β-catenin, extracellular signaling regulated kinase (ERK), and protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathways, which leads to the necessary cellular proliferation and differentiation.",

        "abstract": "Pustular lesions developed in 16% of our psoriatic inpatients treated with a modified Goeckerman regimen. The role of bacterial infection in the development of these lesions remains controversial. Representative lesions were cultured, and the recovered organisms were quantitated. We were not able to culture a significant number of bacteria from these lesions. Pustules were prone to develop during the summer months in hirsute patients, in patients with hyperhidrosis, and in patients in whom topical treatment of a more occlusive nature was applied. The male-female ratio was 4.8:1. Topical antibiotic treatment of these pustules in psoriatic patients appeared to be unwarranted since the lesions resolved when topical therapy was discontinued. These pustules appeared to be distinct from pustular psoriasis.",

        "abstract": "A drug interaction develops when the effect of a drug is increased or decreased or when a new effect is produced by the prior, concurrent, or subsequent administration of the other. Before prescribing a drug, it is important to obtain a thorough drug history of the prescription and nonprescription medications taken by the patient. The nonprescription medications may include items such as nutritional supplements and herbal medications. The risk of side effects is an inevitable consequence of drug use. The frequency of adverse reactions is increased in those patients receiving multiple medications. Drug interactions reported in animal or in vitro studies may not necessarily develop in humans. When drug interactions are observed with a particular agent, it cannot be automatically assumed that all closely related drugs will necessarily produce the same interaction. However, caution is advised until sufficient experience accrues. The prescriber should not overestimate or underestimate the potential for a given drug interaction on the basis of personal experience alone. Drug interactions will not necessarily occur in every patient who is given a particular combination of drugs known to produce an interaction. For a clinically significant drug interaction to be manifest, several other factors may be relevant other than just using the two drugs. In many instances drug interactions can be predicted and therefore avoided if the pharmacodynamic effects, the pharmacokinetic properties, and the mechanisms of action of the 2 drugs in question are known. In the case of contraindicated drugs, it may be possible to use an alternative agent.",

Nondermatophyte molds such as Scopulariopsis brevicaulis may uncommonly result in cutaneous infections. Scytalidium dimidiatum (Scytalidium anamorph of Hendersonula toruloidea) and Scytalidium hyalinum may cause interdigital tinea pedis, and less frequently \"moccasin foot\" or plantar tinea pedis. Nondermatophytes have generally responded poorly to griseofulvin and ketoconazole. There have been reports of some nondermatophyte fungi responding to itraconazole and terbinafine.",

We searched the PubMed database, the Food and Drug Administration 510(k) database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar for in vitro studies, peer-reviewed clinical trials, manufacturers' white papers, and registered clinical trials of laser systems indicated for the treatment of onychomycosis. All published clinical trials were assessed on a 20-point methodological quality scale. We identified three basic science articles, five peer-reviewed articles, three white papers, and four pending clinical trials, as well as numerous gray literature documents. The overall methodological score for the clinical trials was 9.1 ± 1.1, with peer-reviewed studies showing a higher score (9.8 ± 1.5) than white papers (7.5 ± 0.7). We also identified 11 commercial laser device systems of varying global availability. Laser therapy has been tested and approved as a cosmetic treatment only for onychomycosis. It cannot be recommended as a therapeutic intervention to eradicate fungal infection at this time as more rigorous randomized, controlled trials are required to determine if laser therapy is efficacious on par with oral and topical interventions.",

One year later, a bypass catheter was inserted in the right ureter for high-grade obstruction also by renal calculi. He was subsequently found to have end-stage renal disease and began receiving dialysis. He later received a cadaveric renal transplant.More recently, he developed cardiac dysrhythmias and was found to have a third-degree heart block. A His bundle recording of the conduction system of the heart revealed an infra-His bundle heart block. An endocardial biopsy specimen of the right ventricle is shown in Fig 2. The ventricle was dilated and the ejection fraction of the ventricle was markedly reduced.",

        "abstract": "Onychomycosis is an uncommon condition in childhood, but prevalence in children is increasing worldwide.The objective was to review the efficacy and safety of systemic and topical antifungal agents to treat onychomycosis in children. Databases (Pubmed, OVID , Scopus, clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane Library) were searched. Seven studies were selected for inclusion. Only one was a randomized controlled trial. In total, 208 children were administered antifungal agents for the treatment of onychomycosis. Four reports of mild adverse events were documented (1.9% of treated children), one of which discontinued treatment (0.5%). Limitations of this review are the lack of randomized controlled trials available in pediatric onychomycosis. These findings suggest that antifungal therapies used to treat onychomycosis in children are associated with a low incidence of adverse events. Current dosing regimens for antifungal drugs are effective and appear safe to use in children, notwithstanding that the Food and Drug Administration has not approved any of these agents for the treatment of onychomycosis in children. To our knowledge, this review is the most up‐to‐date, comprehensive summary of pediatric onychomycosis treatment.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Onychomycosis is a fungal nail infection caused by dermatophytes, non-dermatophyte molds, and yeasts. Treatment of this infection can be difficult, with relapse likely to occur within 2.5 years of cure. The objective of this article is to review factors that can impact cure and to suggest practical techniques that physicians can use to maximize cure rates. Co-morbidities, as well as disease severity and duration, are among the many patient factors that could influence the efficacy of antifungal therapies. Furthermore, organism, treatment, and environmental factors that may hinder cure include point mutations, biofilms, affinity for non-target enzymes, and exposure to fungal reservoirs. To address patient-related factors, physicians are encouraged to conduct confirmatory testing and treat co-morbidities such as tinea pedis early and completely. To combat organism-focused factors, it is recommended that disruption of biofilms is considered, and drugs with multiple routes of delivery and unique mechanisms of action are prescribed when traditional agents are not effective. Extending follow-up periods, using combination treatments, and considering pulse regimens may also be of benefit. Through these practical techniques, physicians can maximize cure and limit the risk of relapse and re-infection.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Onychomycosis is an infection of the nail plate that is an important priority area for the development of antifungal drugs. The high incidence of relapse and reinfection often makes onychomycosis a chronic condition. The current gold standard is oral therapy, but the development of effective topical agents remains a priority as they have fewer systemic interactions. This review summarizes development of antifungals from early phase development through Phase III clinical trials for onychomycosis. The oral molecules in development are azole molecules. Topical drugs in development include azoles, allylamines, benzoxaboroles and nanoemulsions. Photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy and new laser systems are also emerging therapeutic options. There is a diverse array of antifungal drugs in the early phases of development. The goals of onychomycosis therapy are a mycological cure and a normal appearing nail. The recent development of topical antifungals has been successful at improving the nail permeation and efficacy. The diversification of molecular targets is the next primary goal of antifungal development. Incomplete treatment of onychomycosis provides an environment conducive to the development of antifungal resistance. New topical agents and device-based therapies expand the therapeutic options. Combination therapy using multiple drug classes may improve the overall efficacy of antifungal treatment in onychomycosis. ",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Onychomycosis may be caused by dermatophytes (which form the majority of organisms), Candida species, and nondermatophyte molds. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of itraconazole and terbinafine in the treatment of some nondermatophyte molds that cause toe onychomycosis and to review the literature on the treatment of nondermatophyte mold toe onychomycosis using the oral antifungal agents. Patients with nondermatophyte mold toe onychomycosis were treated in an open, prospective manner with either itraconazole (pulse) or terbinafine therapy. In each instance, light microscopic examination was consistent with the diagnosis of a nondermatophyte mold. For each patient, mycological evaluation of the target nail resulted in 3 or more successive cultures yielding growth of the mold alone. All 15 patients had onychomycosis of the toes which was of the distal and lateral type. The patients were treated with itraconazole given as the standard 3 pulses with additional pulses administered depending upon the response exhibited by the toe onychomycosis in the patient. Similarly, terbinafine was given for 12 weeks with additional therapy administered as dictated by the response. Efficacy parameters were mycological cure (MC) and clinical cure (CC). Mycological cure was negative light microscopic examination (KOH) and culture. Clinical cure was the appearance of a completely normal-looking nail. At month 12 from the start of treatment, the response was as follows: Scopulariopsis brevicaulis: itraconazole (MC 4/4, CC 2/4) and terbinafine (MC 0/1, CC 0/1), Fusarium species: itraconazole (MC 1/1, CC 1/1) and terbinafine (MC 0/1, CC 0/1), Aspergillus species: itraconazole (MC 5/6, CC 3/6), Alternaría alternata: itraconazole (MC 0/1, CC 0/1), and Onychocola canadensis: itraconazole (MC 1/1, CC 0/1). There were no significant clinical or laboratory adverse effects. In the present series itraconazole demonstrated efficacy against onychomycosis of the toenails caused by 5. brevicaulis and Aspergillus species. A review of the literature confirms our experience with itraconazole and further suggests that terbinafine may also demonstrate efficacy against cases of S. brevicaulis and Aspergillus toe onychomycosis. Additionally, reports in the literature suggest that pedal onychomycosis caused by Fusarium species may also show response to itraconazole and terbinafine. For the other species, there are fewer data, making it difficult to draw conclusions.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Acremonium is known to be regularly isolated from food and also to be a cause of human disease. Herein, we resolve some sources of confusion that have strongly hampered the accurate interpretation of these and other isolations. The recently designated type species of the genus Acremonium, A. alternatum, is known only from a single isolate, but it is the closest known relative of what may be one of the planet’s most successful organisms, Acremonium sclerotigenum/egyptianum, shown herein to be best called by its earliest valid name, A. egyptiacum. The sequencing of ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, actin genes, or both for 72 study isolates within this group allowed the full range of morphotypes and ITS barcode types to be elucidated, along with information on temperature tolerance and habitat. The results showed that nomenclatural confusion and frequent misidentifications facilitated by morphotaxonomy, along with misidentified early sequence deposits, have obscured the reality that this species is, in many ways, the definitive match of the historical concept of Acremonium: a pale orange or dull greenish-coloured monophialidic hyphomycete, forming cylindrical, ellipsoidal, or obovoid conidia in sticky heads or obovoid conidia in dry chains, and acting ecologically as a soil organism, marine organism, plant pathogen, plant endophyte, probable insect pathogen, human opportunistic pathogen, food contaminant, probable dermatological communicable disease agent, and heat-tolerant spoilage organism. Industrially, it is already in exploratory use as a producer of the antibiotic ascofuranone, active against trypanosomes, cryptosporidia, and microsporidia, and additional applications are in development. The genus-level clarification of the phylogeny of A. egyptiacum shows other historic acremonia belong to separate genera, and two are here described, Parasarocladium for the Acremonium radiatum complex and Kiflimonium for the Acremonium curvulum complex.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "In an open trial, five patients with lamellar ichthyosis showed no response to four weeks of treatment with oral cyclosporine (cyclosporine A) (6 mg/kg/d). Histologic examination of lamellar ichthyosis revealed hyperkeratosis; psoriasiform acanthosis; dilated, tortuous capillaries; and a slight perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Immunofluorescence studies revealed, in the epidermis, normal numbers of T6+DR+ Langerhans' cells and an absence of T cells and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression. In the papillary dermis, there were prominent capillaries as detected by staining with anti-factor VIII-related antigen. The endothelial cells also expressed large amounts of HLA-DR and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, suggesting that they were activated. Only occasional Langerhans' cells were found in the dermis. Histologic and immunofluorescence findings were unchanged with cyclosporine therapy. The effects of cyclosporine on lamellar ichthyosis are contrasted with those reported for psoriasis. Since lamellar ichthyosis and psoriasis share similar features of epidermal hyperproliferation and the presence of activated, dilated, tortuous vessels, but differ in the lack of immunologic cellular activity, their contrasting response to cyclosporine suggests that the target of the action of cyclosporine is the immune system rather than the keratinocyte or the endothelium. However, other factors may have to be considered.",

        "abstract": "Several diagnoses in the new DSM-5 chapter on ‘Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders’ directly relate to psychodermatology. The new excoriation (skin-picking) disorder (SPD) and trichotillomania (TTM) both manifest as recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors that have compulsive and dissociative features, the latter being more prevalent in TTM than SPD. The DSM-5 refers to SPD and TTM occurring without full awareness or preceding tension, however does not specifically mention the possible role of dissociation. This has important treatment implications, as patients with high dissociative symptoms are not likely to respond to the standard treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), which is frequently associated with cutaneous body image (CBI) dissatisfaction, is present in 9 %-15 % of dermatology patients. Treatment guidelines in dermatology are increasingly considering the psychosocial morbidity related to CBI in their treatment outcome measures. The presence of BDD, if unrecognized, may therefore directly affect the dermatologic treatment regimens offered to the patient.",

        "abstract": "It is well recognized that the clinical course of many dermatologic disorders is the result of a complex and sometimes reciprocal interaction between biological, psychiatric/psychological, and social factors that can have a predisposing, precipitating, and/or perpetuating role for the dermatologic disorder. Assessment of psychiatric and psychosocial comorbidity, which can be present in up to 30% of dermatology patients, is an important component of the overall clinical evaluation of the patient. This paper discusses a practical approach to the assessment of psychosocial and psychiatric factors, including suicide risk and parasuicidal behaviors in the dermatology patient. The approach further classifies these factors as predisposing, precipitating, and/or perpetuating, in order to aid the clinician with the possible secondary and tertiary prevention of some dermatologic disorders by management of their psychosocial and psychiatric comorbidity.",

As the prevalence of onychomycosis is increasing, a critical review of diagnostic techniques and treatment options is required. This review discusses the current diagnostic techniques associated with diagnosing onychomycosis, such as microscopy, culture, periodic acid Schiff stain (PAS) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Oral and topical therapies are also discussed, as well as, the utility of device-based treatments and combination therapy. Culture for the diagnosis of onychomycosis is the gold standard; however, PCR is more sensitive and should be considered. In general, topical treatments are recommended for mild to moderate disease and oral treatments should be considered for moderate to severe disease. Combination therapy and device-based treatments may enhance cure rates, further study is required.",

This review builds on the antifungal therapy update published in this journal for the first special issue on Dermatophytosis (Gupta and Cooper 2008;166:353–67). Since 2008, there have not been additions to the oral antifungal armamentarium, with terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole still in widespread use, albeit for generally more severe or recalcitrant infections. Griseofulvin is used in the treatment of tinea capitis. Oral ketoconazole has fallen out of favor in many jurisdictions due to risks of hepatotoxicity. Topical antifungals, applied once or twice daily, are the primary treatment for tinea pedis, tinea corporis/tinea cruris, and mild cases of tinea unguium. Newer topical antifungal agents introduced include the azoles, efinaconazole, luliconazole, and sertaconazole, and the oxaborole, tavaborole. Research is focused on developing formulations of existing topical antifungals that utilize novel delivery systems in order to enhance treatment efficacy and compliance.",

        "abstract": "Fluconazole could be an alternative to terbinafine and itraconazole for onychomycosis treatment. However, it is difficult to determine the optimal dosing regimen due to the variability in causative agents, dosing regimens and cure rates in clinical trials. By restricting the data to dermatophyte onychomycosis, we aimed to identify an optimal fluconazole dosing regimen. Methods: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE and CENTRAL databases and the reference sections of published literature for clinical trials on fluconazole monotherapy for culture-proven dermatophyte onychomycosis. Relationships between fluconazole doses, cure rates and duration of therapy were analyzed. Results: Longer treatments, but not higher weekly fluconazole doses, resulted in better cure rates for toenail, and possibly fingernail, onychomycosis. Consequently, mean mycological and clinical cure rates for treatments lasting 6 months or less and more than 6 months were significantly different for toenail onychomycosis. Clinical studies including participants with nondermatophyte mold, Candida species, or negative culture onychomycosis only used fluconazole therapy for 6 months or less. Thus, the relationship between cure rates and duration of treatment could not be confirmed for all causative agents. Conclusion: The lowest dose of 150 mg weekly for more than 6 months is recommended for onychomycosis.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Onychomycosis is a difficult-to-treat fungal infection of the nails. The efficacy of monotherapy is not ideal, and combination therapies provide an alternative that may increase treatment efficacy. A retrospective analysis of data from 91 patients was undertaken. Treatment for toenail onychomycosis occurred between 2014 and 2016 and consisted of combination therapy with oral terbinafine (250 mg/day for 12 weeks) or itraconazole (3 pulses, 400 mg/day for 7 days) + K101 nail solution daily, or K101 nail solution monotherapy. Efficacy outcomes at 12 and 15 months were analyzed. At 12 months, the clinical cure rate for combination of terbinafine + K101 solution was significantly higher than that for K101 monotherapy (p = 0.008). Patients receiving this combination also showed significant improvement in percent of affected nail at 3 months (p = 0.029), while patients receiving itraconazole + K101 solution demonstrated improvement in percent of affected nail at 6 months (p = 0.037). At 15 months, there was no significant difference between treatments for complete, clinical, and mycological cure. Conclusion: Combination therapy with oral terbinafine or itraconazole and K101 nail solution results in clearance of infected nail earlier than that with topical K101 alone. These combinations may encourage compliance and be effective for patients with moderate onychomycosis.",

        "abstract": "The last 10 years have seen a substantial increase in the number of studies reporting the efficacy of the various antifungal agents used to treat onychomycosis. To examine the definitions of efficacy parameters reported in clinical studies on the treatment of onychomycosis and discuss the importance of standardized reporting. We searched MEDLINE (1966–2001) for studies in which oral treatments, griseofulvin, ketoconazole, terbinafine (continuous and pulse), itraconazole (continuous and pulse), and fluconazole, were used to treat dermatophyte onychomycosis. Mycologic cure was predominantly defined as negative microscopy and culture. Unlike mycologic cure, clinical parameters (e.g. clinical response, clinical cure) were variably defined. Subjective terms, such as “cure” or “markedly improved,” were used; although these terms appear to be explicit, what is considered to be “cured” or “markedly improved” by one evaluator may not be by another. Also, infected nails were clinically evaluated to determine the response to treatment. Studies measured the distance between the proximal nail fold and a notch in the nail plate, at the junction between the diseased and normal‐appearing nail, or in some cases estimated the diseased nail plate involvement. his review of the literature on systemic agents used to treat onychomycosis shows that standard and explicit definitions are required for the accurate comparison of the effectiveness of the various therapies.",

        "abstract": "There is no general agreement as to what constitutes cure or treatment success in onychomycosis. Regulatory guidelines differ in the United States and Europe, and outcomes reported in clinical trials do not consistently report secondary endpoints. We reviewed definitions of onychomycosis cure to develop a less stringent and more practical approach to assess improvement and treatment success. Complete cure (totally clear nail and mycologic cure) remains an important regulatory standard. Mycologic cure (negative fungal culture and negative potassium hydroxide) is the only consistently reported outcome in clinical trials, however the potential for discrepancies between microscopy and culture can be problematic. We propose a more practical approach to assessing improvement in infected nails that relies on both physician and patient input in a similar fashion to other skin diseases. Treatment success should be based on both physician and patient assessment of improvement in the affected toenails and negative fungal culture.",

        "abstract": "Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) differs from lichen planopilaris (LPP) in many clinical aspects, but histology fails to distinguish between these entities. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) is a diagnostic technique used for autoimmune diseases, including those affecting skin and hair. To characterize DIF patterns in patients with FFA. Method: Data was collected retrospectively from FFA cases presenting to the Centre de Santé Sabouraud Hair Clinic in Paris from November 2013 to November 2014. Of 149 patients with FFA, 44 cases underwent DIF. Thirteen cases showed positive results with DIF. Patterns characteristic of LPP and lupus erythematosus were observed, with nearly half showing nonspecific staining. Conclusion: DIF patterns in patients with FFA were variable. This diagnostic technique should be used with caution in cases of cicatricial alopecia, particularly FFA.",

        "abstract": "Scarring is an important component of overall acne severity, but there are no global scales for its evaluation inclusive of the face and trunk. Our objective was to develop a global scale for acne scar severity inclusive of the trunk and the face. A six-category global severity scale (SCAR-S) was developed for assessment of acne scarring at each of the face, chest, and back. We evaluated SCAR-S against acne severity and patient-reported scar severity. Of 973 subjects, 73% reported acne scarring. Self-assessment of scarring was associated with facial SCAR-S and overall SCAR-S scores (p < .001, r = .31 and .30, respectively). Acne scarring was observed at the face in 87%, the back in 51%, and the chest in 38%. Clinically relevant scarring (mild or greater) at each of these regions was 55%, 24%, and 14%, respectively. Acne severity correlated with SCAR-S (p < .001) for the back (r = .612), the chest (r = .548), and the face (r = .514). Acne duration correlated with patient-reported severity of scarring (r = .244) and overall SCAR-S scores (r = .152). Clinically relevant scarring increased with acne duration. SCAR-S is a practical, validated, global system for acne scar evaluation and is clinically relevant in overall severity grading of acne.",

Fungi are traditionally understood as existing in the environment as planktonic organisms; however, recent advancements in microbiology suggest that fungi form biofilms–complex sessile microbial communities irreversibly attached to epithelial surfaces by means of an extracellular matrix. The extracellular matrix also acts as a protective barrier to the organisms within the biofilm. The biofilm is surprisingly resistant to injury and may act as a persistent source of infection possibly accounting for antifungal resistance in onychomycosis.",

Conduct a meta-analysis of current trial data to estimate efficacy. Thirteen studies which investigated the use of PRP for treatment of AGA were identified from the literature. A meta-analysis was used to analyze results from four trials (N = 60) where sufficient quantifiable data extraction was possible. All 13 studies were analyzed qualitatively. When comparing PRP treatment to baseline, the overall standardized mean difference was 0.51 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.14, 0.88; I2 = 0%] in favour of PRP treatment. Preliminary results suggest that the investigation of PRP for the treatment of AGA is promising. Controlled trials with quantifiable measures of treatment success are now required to confirm these results.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Antipsychotic drugs can be beneficial in dermatology because of their both central nervous system and peripheral effects. All antipsychotic drugs have a central postsynaptic dopamine D2 receptor blocking effect, which underlies their antipsychotic action. The antipsychotic drugs have varying degrees of histamine H1-receptor, cholinergic muscarinic receptor, and α1-adrenergic receptor blocking effects, which can affect cutaneous perception and the autonomic reactivity of the skin and can be potentially beneficial in the management of certain histamine or sympathetically mediated dermatologic manifestations (eg, urticaria, pruritus, hyperhidrosis). In addition to their antipsychotic effect, antipsychotic drugs also have a general anxiolytic effect related in part to their α1-adrenergic receptor blocking action, which can be of benefit in many dermatologic conditions, including pruritus. The antipsychotic drugs are most commonly used in dermatology for the management of a delusional disorder, somatic type, manifesting as delusional infestation, and as monotherapy or as augmentation therapy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, and for management of trichotillomania and skin-picking or excoriation disorder. There is earlier literature (1) on the possible beneficial effect of the phenothiazine antipsychotics in a wide range of pruritic dermatoses, and (2) the efficacy of pimozide as adjunctive therapy for metastatic melanoma, which both warrant further investigation.",

Effective topical treatments capable of penetrating the nail plate and reaching the site of infection continue to be sought. Tavaborole, the first member of a new class of boron-containing antifungals, is a lightweight, water-soluble topical nail solution for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis. Tavaborole has a unique mechanism of action against fungal organisms and retains antifungal properties in the presence of keratin. Tavaborole 5.0% nail solution has shown a favourable safety and efficacy profile in Phase II/III clinical trials and is currently under review for licensing in the US by the US Food and Drug Administration.",

This review aims to evaluate the differences that exist between medications for the treatment of tinea capitis, to determine whether there are any significant adverse effects associated and to define the usefulness of sample collection methods. We conducted a systematic literature search of available papers using the databases PubMed, OVID , Cochrane Libraries and ClinicalTrials.gov. Twenty‐one RCT s and 17 CT s were found. Among the different antifungal therapies (oral and combination thereof), continuous itraconazole and terbinafine had the highest mycological cure rates (79% and 81%, respectively), griseofulvin and terbinafine had the highest clinical cure rates (46% and 58%, respectively) and griseofulvin and terbinafine had the highest complete cure rate (72% and 92%, respectively). Griseofulvin more effectively treated Microsporum infections; terbinafine and itraconazole more effectively cured Trichophyton infections. Only 1.0% of children had to discontinue medication based on adverse events. T. tonsurans was the most common organism found in North America, and hairbrush collection method is the most efficient method of sample collection. Additionally, using a hairbrush, toothbrush or cotton swab to identify the infecting organism(s) is the least invasive and most efficient method of tinea capitis sample collection in children. Current dosing regimens of reported drugs are effective and safe for use in tinea capitis in children.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Toenail onychomycosis is a chronic fungal infection that often requires prolonged treatment in order to effectively manage pathogenic organisms and obtain a clear nail. Traditionally, certain clinical features of onychomycosis, including the presence of substantial lateral disease, focal fungal masses, yellow/brown streaks, and extensive nail involvement (ie, >50%), indicate a poor treatment prognosis and have proven difficult-to-treat with oral or traditional topical therapies. Owing to the novel features of topical tavaborole, we sought to understand the potential utility of tavaborole in difficult-to-treat onychomycosis. A blinded, post-hoc assessment of Phase III trials was conducted, focusing on initial presentation, midpoint assessment (24 weeks), and final outcomes (52 weeks) in subjects identified as having difficult-to-treat onychomycosis and treated for 48 weeks with once-daily application of either tavaborole 5% solution or vehicle. Our post-hoc analysis identified 84 difficult-to-treat cases (tavaborole 5%; n=60; vehicle, n=24) in subjects with toenail onychomycosis due to Trichophyton rubrum or Trichophyton mentagrophytes. No subjects identified as difficult-to-treat and treated with vehicle achieved a complete cure, while 6 subjects treated with tavaborole 5% attained a completely clear nail and negative mycology. Similarly, 7 subjects treated with tavaborole 5% solution achieved an almost complete cure (≤10% involvement and negative mycology) while 1 subject on vehicle achieved an almost complete cure. We present a case series of 4 patients, of varying age and difficult-to-treat clinical features, which responded positively to tavaborole 5% solution. Three of the subjects achieved complete cure after being treated with tavaborole 5%, with one additional subject (an 88-year-old female) achieving an almost complete clear nail by treatment end. The outcomes presented here may not be reflective of patients that may present with these clinical characteristics. Additional investigations would be useful in order to assess the value of topical tavaborole 5% solution in difficult-to-treat clinical presentations of onychomycosis.",

        "abstract": "Alopecia areata (AA) is non-scarring hair loss resulting from an autoimmune disorder. Severity varies from patchy hair loss that often spontaneously resolves to severe and chronic cases that can progress to total loss of scalp and body hair. Many treatments are available; however, the efficacy of these treatments has not been confirmed, especially in severe cases, and relapse rates are high. First-line treatment often includes corticosteroids such as intralesional or topical steroids for mild cases and systemic steroids or topical immunotherapy with diphenylcyclopropenone or squaric acid dibutylester in severe cases. Minoxidil and bimatoprost may also be recommended, usually in combination with another treatment. Ongoing research and new insights into mechanisms have led to proposals of innovative therapies. New directions include biologics targeting immune response as well as lasers and autologous platelet-rich plasma therapy. Preliminary data are encouraging, and it is hoped this research will translate into new options for the treatment of AA in the near future.",

Shortly afterward, a low-grade fever and multiple erythematous, slightly tender nodules, approximately 2×2 cm in size, over the lower extremities were noted. The patient complained of generalized arthralgias at this time. The pruritus, fever, and arthralgias improved, but not the nodules, which eventually resolved with areas of localized lipodystrophy.There were no further episodes until the patient was first seen by us at the age of 9 years, 9 months with a two-week history of progressive erythema and pruritus of the lower extremities that began at his ankles and extended upward to include the upper part of his thighs and his buttocks. There was no family history of lipodystrophy or autoimmune disease.On examination, his temperature was 38°C (100.4°F). Multiple slightly erythematous subcutaneous nodules were",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail primarily caused by the dermatophytes Trichophyton rubrum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The topical-based treatment of onychomycosis remains a challenge because of the difficulty associated with penetrating the dense, protective structure of the keratinized nail plate. Tavaborole is a novel small-molecule antifungal agent recently approved in the United States for the topical treatment of toenail onychomycosis. The low molecular weight, slight water solubility, and boron chemistry of tavaborole maximize nail penetration after topical application, allowing for effective targeting of the infection in the nail bed. The efficacy of tavaborole is associated with its novel mechanism of action, whereby it inhibits the fungal leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS) enzyme. Because LeuRS is an essential component in fungal protein synthesis, inhibition of LeuRS ultimately leads to fungal cell death. Tavaborole is the first boron-based antifungal medication approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate onychomycosis and presents patients with a new topical option. Previously, ciclopirox and efinaconazole were the only approved topical treatments for onychomycosis. This article details the properties that are at the core of the clinical benefits associated with tavaborole.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "We read the findings of Egeberg et al. demonstrating a bidirectional association of the incidence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and vice versa, with great interest.1 It is encouraging to read that the results support the findings of our systematic review2 that suggested a bidirectional association of OSA and psoriasis based on several studies. The authors discuss that the relationship between OSA and psoriasis is likely complex and mediated by underlying inflammatory pathology. This is further supported by their finding1 of a trend for the strongest overall bidirectional association between OSA and psoriatic arthritis (versus psoriasis affecting the skin alone) where the acute inflammatory component is the strongest. It is excellent that the authors have mentioned the possible beneficial effect of CPAP in the treatment of the psoriasis patient with OSA, because of the anti-inflammatory effect of CPAP. This has been reported in cases of recalcitrant psoriasis3 in the past and requires further systematic evaluation. In this large epidemiologic sample,1 it would be very interesting to examine the incidence of OSA in psoriasis patients who were on biological drugs at baseline (these patients were also categorized as having severe psoriasis), and adhered to their treatment versus those who did not. In this study the authors found that greater psoriasis severity at baseline was associated with more severe OSA (Table 2). This requires further clarification as treatment with biological drugs would be expected to be associated with a lower incidence of psoriasis, due to their overall anti-inflammatory effect. However, since the patients on biologics had more severe disease at baseline, at the very least the possible confounding effect of the biological drugs on the future development of OSA should be controlled for statistically. Overall, this study contributes excellent population-based incidence data that suggest that further studies of the treatments for OSA need to focus on the underlying inflammatory pathology, and not just the sleep-related respiratory symptoms.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Ketoconazole was the first broad-spectrum oral antifungal approved by the FDA in 1981. Post-marketing reports of drug-related hepatotoxicity, endocrine dysregulation and drug interactions resulted in market withdrawal of the drug in some countries and strict product relabeling in others. This drug safety review summarizes reports of oral ketoconazole-related adverse events retrieved from a search of the PubMed database using the search strategy ‘ketoconazole OR Nizoral AND hepat*’, references from relevant publications, and data from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. Although oral ketoconazole is effective in treating fungal infections, the potential for drug interactions, endocrine dysregulation, and hepatotoxicity may outweigh its benefits. Newer oral antifungals have similar or greater efficacy in treating dermatologic conditions and are associated with less risk. Likewise, newer agents with specific targets and fewer drug interactions have been developed to treat systemic fungal infections. Therefore, by the time ketoconazole prescribing guidelines were amended, its use had already largely been replaced with newer antifungals. Being that ketoconazole was the first broad-spectrum oral antifungal, experience with the drug made patient safety, and especially hepatic safety, an important consideration in future antifungal development.",

        "abstract": "Patients with long-standing chromoblastomycosis may respond poorly to standard treatments such as amphotericin B, oral antifungals, surgical measures or thermotherapy. The objective of this study was to determine the potential of alternate week and combination therapy with itraconazole and terbinafine in the treatment of poorly responsive, or non-responsive, chromoblastomycosis. Four patients with longstanding chromoblastomycosis (8–23 years) caused by Fonsecaea pedrosoi had responded poorly to standard therapies including monotherapy with the oral antifungal agents. In order to try and improve the response to oral itraconazole and terbinafine, alternate week or combination therapy with itraconazole and terbinafine was initiated. Bloodwork including complete blood count and liver function tests were performed every 3–8 weeks to ensure patient safety. Reduction or resolution of lesions of chromoblastomycosis was noted with alternate week or combination treatment using oral itraconazole and terbinafine. Three of four patients experienced no clinical side-effects; the third reported mild, transient gastric discomfort which responded to antacids. Bloodwork generally remained within normal limits throughout the entire course of treatment with no clinically significant changes. The combination therapy was considered effective in treating the poorly responsive chromoblastomycosis of all four patients. Some success with alternative week therapy was also noted in one patient. The favorable response and lack of significant adverse effects suggests that these regimens may be an option for some patients with chromoblastomycosis.",

At the end of therapy, rheumatologic assessment revealed the following trends in disease activity: a decrease in the number of tender joints, joint tenderness index, duration of morning stiffness, and an increase in grip strength. There was a decrease in the number of swollen joints, joint swelling index, and the time taken to walk 50 ft. Overall disease activity significantly improved as assessed independently by the patient and physician. For psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, disease activity worsened toward baseline within four weeks of discontinuation of therapy. Shortterm, low-dose cyclosporine therapy may be effective in treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.",

        "abstract": "Facial seborrheic dermatitis (SD), a chronic inflammatory skin condition, can impact quality of life, and relapses can be frequent. Three broad categories of agents are used to treat SD: antifungal agents, keratolytics, and corticosteroids. Topical therapies are the first line of defense in treating this condition. Our objective was to critically review the published literature on topical treatments for facial SD. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Clinicaltrials.gov, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane library databases for original clinical studies evaluating topical treatments for SD. We then conducted both a critical analysis of the selected studies by grading the evidence and a qualitative comparison of results among and within studies. A total of 32 studies were eligible for inclusion, encompassing 18 topical treatments for facial SD. Pimecrolimus, the focus of seven of the 32 eligible studies, was the most commonly studied topical treatment. Promiseb®, desonide, mometasone furoate, and pimecrolimus were found to be effective topical treatments for facial SD, as they had the lowest recurrence rate, highest clearance rate, and the lowest severity scores (e.g., erythema, scaling, and pruritus), respectively. Ciclopirox olamine, ketoconazole, lithium (gluconate and succinate), and tacrolimus are also strongly recommended (level A recommendations) topical treatments for facial SD, as they are consistently effective across high-quality trials (randomized controlled trials).",

There is no recurrence eight years after clinical onset of the lesion, making this one of the longest documented cases of survival. A literature review of the disease, including its controversial histiogenesis, treatment, and survival, is presented. In view of the rarity of the disease, only by studying more patients can we better understand the disease. Since more than one disease process may be included under this diagnosis, clearer clinical and histogenetic separation is required, with immunohistochemical techniques potentially helping to provide a more precise diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "Rosacea is a relatively common disorder that may affect individuals of all races, particularly those of northern European decent. Its onset generally occurs in individuals between the ages of 20 and 50 years. Rosacea may be classified into four subtypes and one variant. Although individuals with rosacea may not pass through all of the stages, the primary features of the disorder include frequent flushing and blushing, nontransient erythema, the presence of papules and pustules, and telangiectasia. Many agents have been used to treat rosacea stigmata, especially because none of these is uniformly effective. To identify the parameters that are used to evaluate the response to therapy when different agents are used to treat rosacea. For a given parameter, to determine whether the different trials are consistent in the manner in which this variable is measured. The reports on the efficacy and safety of the different drug therapies used to treat rosacea were identified. We searched MEDLINE (1966 to June 2002) for studies where rosacea was treated. The parameters used to evaluate the efficacy of therapy were determined. For each parameter, the ways in which it has been measured were identified. For each of the parameters that are commonly used to measure the efficacy of treatments for rosacea, the different approaches by which it has been measured in the various trials have been highlighted; these dissimilarities can make it problematic to compare between clinical trials. A greater degree of uniformity in the manner in which the various parameters are evaluated would enable a more objective comparison between the studies.",

However, there are currently no standardized therapeutic regimens for nail psoriasis. Traditional treatments for nail psoriasis, which include topical, intralesional, and oral therapies, may be time-consuming, painful, or unsafe when administered long term. Biologic therapies have demonstrated efficacy for plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis; these therapies may be particularly promising for the treatment of nail psoriasis as both groups of patients have an elevated incidence of nail dystrophy. The biologic therapies adalimumab, alefacept, efalizumab, etanercept, and infliximab have demonstrated clinically important nail psoriasis improvements using the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index, a helpful tool that, upon validation, will allow comparison across treatments and trials. Large-scale, long-term trials using standardized outcome measures are needed to further evaluate biologic therapies for the treatment of nail psoriasis.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "This 16‐year‐old woman was referred for psychiatric management of her dermatitis artefacta that presented as superficial linear abrasions on her thighs and arms. During psychotherapy, the patient disclosed that her father had started sexually molesting her when she was about 8 years old. By age 10 years her father was having sexual intercourse with her. Initially, the patient confused her father's sexual advances with affection, but by age 10 years she became acutely aware of the abusive nature of their relationship. At this time, the father threatened to leave the family if the patient disclosed the sexual abuse. This was very threatening for the patient, since it would mean that her mother and her siblings would end up on welfare. The father then blamed the patient for “seducing him” and continued to abuse her sexually; the patient felt guilty and “bad.” The patient started making superficial linear abrasions on the anterior aspects of her thighs. She described that it helped her “release tension” because the pain helped her to cope with her guilt. The patient was essentially “punishing herself” by inflicting the lesions on herself. The patient also felt “very fat and ugly” and the scars on her body helped to validate this. During the course of therapy, the patient had much difficulty coping with the unresolved anger that began to surface as she acknowledged her feelings regarding the sexual abuse. Initially, she could cope with her anger only by cutting herself, and the symptoms of her dermatitis artefacta became worse. After about 1 year of psychotherapy she was able to acknowledge her feelings more effectively and became much more assertive. This was associated with a marked decrease in the frequency of her self‐mutilative behavior. This 29‐year‐old woman was referred for psychiatric management of her dermatitis artefacta. The patient would typically present to her family doctor with rectangular abrasions on her forearms. The self‐inflicted nature of the lesions was obvious on inspection, but the patient denied remembering that she caused the injury. The patient entered psychotherapy once weekly, and after approximately 6 months, she began to have flashbacks about being sexually abused regularly by an older brother when she was between ages 5–8 years. The patient described dissociative experiences when she was being subjected to the abuse. For example, she felt like “she was watching someone else being abused” and remembers “not feeling anything” while her brother was raping her. Over several months she was able to recognize that she would dissociate whenever faced with emotionally disturbing situations, especially those involving anger. During these dissociative states she would inflict the rectangular abrasions on herself. The patient experienced a significant improvement in the frequency of her dissociative experiences and her self‐mutilative behavior as she acknowledged her anger toward her brother more directly. Chlorpromazine, 25 mg qid, prn, also proved to be a valuable adjunct in her therapy, as it helped her to cope with her very strong anger, and decreased the frequency of her dissociative reactions.",

        "abstract": "To determine the effectiveness and safety of sequential pulse therapy with itraconazole and terbinafine for treating onychomycosis of the fingernails. Open, prospective, multicenter, non-industry-sponsored study lasting up to 48 weeks, which recruited patients from outpatient dermatology clinics in North America. A total of 20 patients with onychomycosis of the fingernails were treated with sequential pulse therapy consisting of one pulse of itraconazole (200 mg twice daily for 1 week) followed 3 weeks later by a pulse of terbinafine (250 mg twice daily for 1 week). Patients were evaluated 4 months from the start of treatment, and if there was mycological evidence of onychomycosis, a supplemental or 'booster' pulse of itraconazole was offered to the patient. The final follow-up observation was carried out 39-48 weeks from the start of therapy. The outcomes evaluated were mycological cure (negative light microscopy and culture), clinical cure (nail appears completely or totally normal) and complete cure (clinical and mycological cure). There were 14 patients with fingernail onychomycosis owing to Trichophyton rubrum and six with Candida onychomycosis. At week 26 from the start of therapy there was mycological cure in 19 of 20 patients. One of the patients with Candida onychomycosis was still clinically affected with mycological evidence of disease and was therefore offered an extra pulse of itraconazole, which resulted in a subsequent cure. At weeks 39-48 from the start of therapy there was mycological cure, clinical cure and complete cure in all 20 patients. Gastrointestinal side effects and headache were reported by three patients and one patient, respectively. These were transient and all patients completed therapy with no dropouts. CONCLUSION: Sequential itraconazole-terbinafine pulse therapy was effective, safe and associated with a high compliance.",

Prevalence estimates of onychomycosis in North American clinic samples have been higher than what has been reported for general populations. A large, multicentre study was conducted to estimate the prevalence of toenail onychomycosis in the Canadian population. Patients were recruited from the offices of three dermatologists and one family physician in Ontario, Canada. Nail samples for mycological testing were obtained from normal and abnormal‐looking nails. This sample of 32 193 patients includes our previous published study of 15 000 patients. Abnormal nails were observed in 4350 patients. Of these, the prevalence of culture‐confirmed toenail onychomycosis was estimated to be 6.7% (95% CI , 6.41–6.96%). Following sex and age adjustments for the general population, the estimated prevalence of toenail onychomycosis in Canada was 6.4% (95% CI , 6.12%–6.65%). The distribution of fungal organisms in culture‐confirmed onychomycosis was 71.9% dermatophytes, 20.4% non‐dermatophyte moulds and 7.6% yeasts. Toenail onychomycosis was four times more prevalent in those over the age of 60 years than below the age of 60 years. The present data highlights that onychomycosis may be a growing medical concern among ageing patients.",

        "abstract": "Despite the fact that lasers are presently indicated for the cosmetic outcome “temporary increase in clear nail”, these devices are increasingly used to treat onychomycosis and particularly in patients who are unwilling or unable to take oral antifungal medication. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued draft guidance for medical device trials for onychomycosis. This review evaluates the quality of laser trials for onychomycosis and compares the design guidelines for medical devices and antifungal drugs. The PubMed database up to 29 May 2015 was searched for clinical studies of laser treatment for onychomycosis. The evidence demonstrating that lasers eradicate pathogenic fungi is limited and published laser trials suffer from limitations such as incomplete reporting of randomization and lack of stratified analyzes for fingernail/toenail data and infecting organisms. Differences in inclusion criteria and efficacy outcomes between drug and device guidelines may prevent the comparison of results from device and drug trials. We propose the standardization of device guidelines to match those of antifungal drug trials. Patients and physicians need to be aware of the capabilities and limitations of laser treatment for onychomycosis.",

New evidence suggests that disease prognosis may be linked to pathogens manipulating host immune responses. Therefore, individuals with specific mutations, including those affecting pattern recognition receptors or the interleukin (IL)–17 and IL-22 pathways, may be more susceptible to infection. Moreover, it is recommended that those with a family history of immune mutations or predisposition to fungal disease be treated aggressively for onychomycosis prior to symptom progression. In addition, incorporating genetic testing and new investigational therapy such as IL-33 and interferon-γ may improve treatment outcome.",

We studied 523 consecutive white patients who had received renal transplants at a Canadian medical center. Malignant neoplasms developed in 7.5% of these patients, and 72% of these neoplasms were cutaneous in origin. Compared with the general population, the rate of development of all skin cancers, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma was 3.2, 18.4, and 1.4 times, respectively. In our study the squamous cell carcinoma to basal cell carcinoma ratio was 2.3:1, compared with 0.2:1 in the general population. There was no significant difference in the site of development of skin cancer in patients with renal transplants compared with the general population. There was, however, a propensity for the development of multiple skin cancers at an earlier age, especially on sun-exposed areas. The results of this study have been compared with those of other world medical centers.",

        "abstract": "Topical medications are the most commonly prescribed treatments for acne patients. However, adherence to these treatments and possible associations with clinical severity and quality of life (QoL) impact are unclear. We evaluated the association between sociodemographic factors, clinical severity, and QoL impact and adherence to topical acne treatments. This was an observational study of acne patients referred for usual care to community-based dermatologists. Adherence was assessed with questionnaires after 2 months of acne therapy. The associations of adherence with factors of interest were evaluated by chi-square analysis and Spearman rank correlation. In 152 acne patients treated with topical medications, low adherence was observed in 26%, medium in 49%, and high in 24%. Age, gender, duration of acne, education level, third-party drug plan coverage, smoking history, recreational drug use, ingestion of alcohol, and number of prescribed topical agents were not significantly associated with adherence. Adherence was significantly positively correlated with QoL impact (r = .24, p = .003), with the role-emotional and self-perception domains having the highest correlations. In contrast, adherence was weakly negatively correlated with facial acne severity (r = .16, p = .047). This study focused on facial acne, and adherence was based on patient reporting. Adherence to topical acne therapy increases with impact on QoL but decreases with increasing acne severity.",

        "abstract": "Recurrence rates are high for onychomycosis, with prophylactic topical antifungal use proposed to counter recurrence. Although this is a reasonable action for many clinicians, few studies have been conducted on the efficacy of topical prophylaxis. A retrospective chart review (2010–2015) was conducted in patients receiving oral terbinafine or itraconazole for toenail onychomycosis. Following complete cure, a topical antifungal (amorolfine, bifonazole, ciclopirox olamine, or terbinafine spray) was used weekly as prophylaxis. Recurrence was recorded along with patient characteristics including demographics and concomitant medical conditions. Data from 320 patients were collected. Recurrence was significantly lower in patients receiving topical antifungal prophylaxis than in no prophylactic treatment following oral terbinafine (p  < .001), but not itraconazole (p  = .185). Regardless of oral treatment, the use of topical antifungals as prophylaxis (p  < .001) decreased, and the number of affected toenails (p  = .048) and family history of fungal infections (p  < .001) increased the likelihood that recurrence would occur. This study supports the use of topical antifungal medications as prophylactic treatment to help prevent recurrence of toenail onychomycosis and suggests that those with a family history of fungal infections should be closely monitored.",

        "abstract": "Mycological culture is the traditional method for identifying infecting agents of onychomycosis despite high false-negative results, slower processing, and complications surrounding nondermatophyte mold (NDM) infections. Molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods are faster and suited for ascertaining NDM infections. To measure agreement between culture and PCR methods for identification of infecting species of suspected onychomycosis, single toenail samples from 167 patients and repeated serial samples from 43 patients with suspected onychomycosis were processed by culture and PCR for identification of 16 dermatophytes and five NDMs. Agreement between methods was quantified using the kappa statistic (κ). The methods exhibited fair agreement for the identification of all infecting organisms (single samples: κ = 0.32; repeated samples: κ = 0.38). For dermatophytes, agreement was moderate (single samples: κ = 0.44; repeated samples: κ = 0.42). For NDMs, agreement was poor with single samples (κ = 0.16) but fair with repeated samples (κ = 0.25). Excluding false-negative reports from analyses improved agreement between methods in all cases except the identification of NDMs from single samples. Culture was three or four times more likely to report a false-negative result compared with PCR. The increased agreement between methods observed by excluding false-negative reports statistically clarifies and highlights the major discord caused by false-negative cultures. The increased agreement of NDM identification from poor to fair with repeated sampling along with their poor agreement in the single samples, with and without false-negatives, affirms the complications of NDM identification and supports the recommendation that serial samples help confirm the diagnosis of NDM infections.",

        "abstract": "There are no large-scale studies ofpolypharmacy (PP) in dermatology. The authors examined trends in PP (simultaneous use of > or = 4 medications in our study) and associated clinical factors among a nationally representative sample of 46,273 (weighted count +/- standard error [SE]: 617,970,596 +/- 25,187,959) dermatology-related (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes 680-709) patient visits from 1995 to 2009. Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Survey were examined. The overall frequency (+/- SE) of PP was 8.9% +/- 0.4%. There was almost a doubling in the frequency of PP in dermatology from 1995 to 2009 (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.67-2.44, after controlling for comorbidities and sex). This increase was noted among patients with > 1 diagnoses, and all age groups including the younger than 25 age category (PP frequency +/- SE, 7.4% +/- 0.4%; OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.12-1.88), and not just among patients in the geriatric age range with multiple complex dermatologic problems. Some of the most frequent conditions in the PP group included acne, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and infections of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, conditions that are known to be affected by psychodermatologic factors. PP among these patients may in part be an indication of their complex presentation caused by psychosocial vs dermatopathologic factors.",

        "abstract": "Dermatologic symptoms can be associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in several situations: (1) as features of some core PTSD symptoms, such as intrusion symptoms manifesting as cutaneous sensory flashbacks, as autonomic arousal manifesting as night sweats and idiopathic urticaria, and as dissociation manifesting as numbness and dermatitis artefacta; (2) the cutaneous psychosomatic effects of emotional and physical neglect and sexual abuse (eg, infantile eczema, cutaneous self-injury, and body-focused repetitive behaviors such as trichotillomania and skin picking disorder) and eating disorders, which can have dermatologic effects; (3) the direct effect of physical or sexual abuse or catastrophic life events (eg, earthquakes) on the skin; and (4) as a result of significant alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and sympatho-adrenal medullary axes, which can affect neuroendocrine and immune functions, and can lead to exacerbations of stress-reactive inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis, chronic urticaria, and atopic dermatitis. Elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers and impaired epidermal barrier function have been reported in situations involving sustained psychologic stress and sleep deprivation. Some PTSD patients show hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyporesponsiveness and higher circulating T lymphocytes, which can exacerbate immune-mediated dermatologic disorders. PTSD should be considered an underlying factor in the chronic, recurrent, or treatment-resistant stress-reactive dermatoses and in patients with self-induced dermatoses.",

Approximately 20% to 25% of patients with onychomycosis do not respond to treatment, and 10% to 53% of patients relapse. As such, successful treatment is imperative for long-term disease management. To identify ways to improve cure rates for onychomycosis. The literature on onychomycosis treatment and recurrence was reviewed to summarize treatment approaches and suggest strategies to increase cure rates. To improve treatment success in onychomycosis, we suggest the following measures be followed: (1) onychomycosis must be correctly diagnosed, (2) the treatment regimen should be tailored to the individual patient, (3) the efficacy of antifungals must be maximized, and (4) recurrence must be prevented.",

        "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic, relapsing, cutaneous condition with a 1%–2% prevalence in the general population. About 40% of psoriatics report that psychosocial stress significantly exacerbates their condition. However, the clinical characteristics of the subgroup of psoriatic patients who are stress reactors have not been delineated. At a practical clinical level it is there-fore difficult to implement specific psychosocial treatments among the psoriatic population. In this study, we compared the psychocutaneous characteristics of patients who reported that stress exacerbated their psoriasis, i.e., the high stress reactors (N = 64) to the subgroup who reported no significant association between stress and their psoriasis, i.e., the low stress reactors (N = 63). The high stress reactors had more disfiguring disease clinically (p < 0.02); psychologically they tended to rely more upon the approval of others (p < 0.05) and experienced more psoriasis-related daily stress (p < 0.005). The high stress reactors also reported more flare-ups of their psoriasis during the 6 months prior to admission (p < 0.05). We have shown that the high stress reactors can be clinically delineated from the low stress reactors. Certain psychosocial interventions will most likely decrease the morbidity associated with psoriasis among the high stress reactors, and may possibly even result in a decline in the number of major flare-ups of the psoriasis.",

        "abstract": "Tinea pedis and onychomycosis often co-occur in individuals. A relationship between swimming pools and tinea pedis exists; however, little research has investigated the relationship between onychomycosis, tinea pedis, and swimming pools. This study sought to examine the prevalence of tinea pedis and onychomycosis among swimming pool employees, a population that may be at risk of tinea infections. Samples were taken from 169 employees at 21 swimming pools in the Netanya area, Israel. KOH microscopy and culture was used to identify fungi. About 46 % of swimming pool employees had concurrent tinea pedis and onychomycosis, 30 % had tinea pedis only, and 6 % had onychomycosis only, compared to 10, 8, and 8 % of controls, respectively. After adjusting for age and gender, swimming pool employees were 20× more likely to have concurrent tinea pedis and onychomycosis, 15× more likely to have tinea pedis only, and 3× more likely to have onychomycosis only compared to controls. The present results are in agreement with previous research and support that swimming pools remain an important source of fungal contamination. More attention to hygienic guidelines and preventative measures may be needed in these settings.",

The patients also self‐rated the severity of their psoriasis. 9.7% of patients reported a wish to be dead, and 5.5% reported active suicidal ideation at the time of the study. The death wish and suicidal ideation were associated with higher depression scores (P < 0.0001) and higher patient self‐ratings of psoriasis severity (P < 0,05). Patient self‐reports of psoriasis severity correlated directly with the overall depression scores (r = 0.39), P < 0.0001). The comorbidity between depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and psoriasis severity is in contrast with reports that severe depression and suicidal ideation are mainly a feature of life‐threatening medical disorders such as malignancies. Our finding may have important implications in the management of psoriasis. ",

Since their development, oral therapies have represented the gold standard for treatment over other methods. However, efficacy with oral therapies remains limited, and safety may be an issue, leaving many patients requiring alternative treatments. With research advances, topical therapies as alternatives for onychomycosis are being investigated with greater interest as new technologies are overcoming previous limitations of topical treatments, such as lack of nail penetration. New device-related topical therapy methods are particularly noteworthy, as they may allow for shorter, more convenient treatments for patients, reducing issues with topical compliance, and, in cases of non-drug light-based therapies, they will avoid potential for drug reactions. Research in these fields is preliminary, and the impact these methods may have on the future of onychomycosis remains to be seen.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Actinic keratosis lesions occur frequently on sun-exposed skin of Caucasians. They become more prevalent with advancing age and are important in identifying the risk factor of those people possibly predisposed to invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Topical therapies are useful alternatives to cryotherapy for treating diffuse actinic damage and a number of preparations have been developed for treating actinic keratosis. A cumulative meta-analysis was performed to determine the efficacy of imiquimod 5% cream, which presents a new alternative topical therapy for actinic keratosis, and to compare it to 5-fluorouracil for the treatment of actinic keratosis lesions of the face and scalp. We searched MEDLINE (1966 to October 2004) for relevant studies evaluating the efficacy of actinic keratosis topical agents imiquimod and 5-fluorouracil (0.5%, 1%, and 5%). Studies included in this meta-analysis required a dosage regimen that was not significantly different from that approved by Health Canada and the U.S. FDA. Studies also required a well-defined treatment duration and followup period, with the primary efficacy variable being the complete (100%) clearance of all actinic keratosis lesions defined as the proportion of patients at followup with no clinically visible lesions in the treatment area. To determine the average efficacy rate for both drugs, the data from each study were combined for that drug. The results of this meta-analysis show that both imiquimod and 5-fluorouracil are effective methods for the treatment of actinic keratosis and provide a useful alternative to cryotherapy. However, this analysis suggests that imiquimod may have higher efficacy than 5-fluorouracil for actinic keratosis lesions located on the face and scalp and therefore provides another option to dermatologists.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the management of mild-to-moderate dermatophytic onychomycosis not involving the lunula. Previously, the agents that were approved for the treatment of dermatophytic pedal onychomycosis--griseofulvin, itraconazole, and terbinafine--were administered orally. When ciclopirox nail lacquer is used, it is recommended that the infected nail undergo debridement by a health-care professional as frequently as monthly. It is important to be aware of the circumstances under which debridement of the mycotic nail may be considered medically necessary and therefore potentially eligible for reimbursement by third-party payers. For many nail presentations, nail debridement is an important component of a treatment protocol involving either the oral medications or the topical lacquer, as it serves to reduce the fungal load and ameliorate symptoms. With the availability of a new FDA-approved topical treatment alternative, it remains to be seen if podiatrists will embrace the definitive treatment of onychomycosis using the newer oral agents, the new nail lacquer, or both in combination with nail debridement to treat the disease.",

        "abstract": "Trichotillomania (TTM) is a psychodermatologic disorder that is typically first seen in the dermatology clinic. There are no reported studies of TTM from nationally representative samples. The authors examined epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of an estimated 695,588±136,456 (unweighted count = 89) patient visits with physician-diagnosed TTM (using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] code 312.39) from a nationally representative US sample. An estimated 20.6%±7.4% visits for TTM were by patients 12 years and younger and demonstrated no sex difference (P=.52). Overall, TTM patients were younger (mean age: 24.01±3.09 years) (P<.001) and more likely to be female (80.3%±6.2%) (P=.003). These demographic findings are consistent with standard diagnostic criteria for TTM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition). There were no racial (white vs nonwhite) differences in TTM frequency. Psychiatric disorders were seen in 75.5%±9.1% of TTM patient visits, with depressive disorder being the most common comorbidity (37.8%±9.5%) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants the most commonly (50.6%±9.7%) used medication. These findings highlight the importance of psychiatric comorbidity in TTM.",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Antifungal agents can be co-administered alongside several other medications for a variety of reasons such as the presence of comorbidities. Pharmacodynamic interactions such as synergistic and antagonistic interactions could be the result of co-administered medications. Pharmacokinetic interactions could also transpire through the inhibition of metabolizing enzymes and drug transport systems, altering the absorption, metabolism and excretion of co-administered medications. Both pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions can result in hospitalization due to serious adverse effects associated with antifungal agents, lower therapeutic doses required to achieve desired antifungal activity, and prevent antifungal resistance. The objective of this review is to summarize pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions associated with common antifungal agents used to treat superficial fungal infections. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interactions that impact the therapeutic effects of antifungal agents and drugs that are influenced by the presence of antifungal agents was the context to which these antifungal agents were addressed. The potential for drug-drug interactions is minimal for topical antifungals as opposed to oral antifungals as they have minimal exposure to other co-administered medications. Developing non-lipophilic antifungals that have unique metabolizing pathways and are topical applied are suggested properties that could help limit drug-drug interactions associated with future treatments.",

The AEDs may be effective in the management of (1) chronic pruritus, including pruritus due systemic disease, including uremia, neuropathic pain, neuropathic pruritus, and complex cutaneous sensory syndromes, especially where central nervous system (CNS) sensitization plays a role; (2) management of emotional dysregulation and the resultant repetitive self-excoriation or other cutaneous self-injury in patients who repetitively stimulate or manipulate their integument to regulate emotions (prurigo nodularis, lichen simplex chronicus, skin picking disorder, trichotillomania); (3) management of dermatologic clinical manifestations associated with autonomic nervous system activation (hyperhidrosis, urticaria, flushing; these often occur in conjunction with psychiatric disorders with prominent autonomic activation and dysregulation, eg, social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder); and (4) when certain anticonvulsants have a direct therapeutic effect (eg, in psoriasis); currently the use of AEDs for such cases is largely experimental. Gabapentin (dosage range 300-3600 mg daily) is the most widely studied AED mood stabilizer in dermatology and is especially effective in situations where CNS sensitization is a mediating factor. Further larger-scale controlled studies of AEDs in dermatology are necessary.",

Imiquimod induces cytokines and enhances cell-mediated cytolytic antiviral activity in vivo. It exhibits antiviral and antitumor effects; however, it does not exhibit direct antiviral effects in vitro. By inducing cytokines, such as interferon a, imiquimod stimulates both the innate immune response and the cellular arm of acquired immunity. Currently, imiquimod is approved for use in the treatment of external genital and perianal warts in adults. Conclusion: Beyond its established use, there are case reports and preliminary studies suggesting the effectiveness of imiquimod 5% cream in the treatment of nongenital human papillomavirus warts, molluscum contagiosum, actinic keratosis, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease, nongenital human papillomavirus infection, and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.",

We present the case of a patient who developed a superficial spreading melanoma 3 years after first being treated with PUVA. The development of melanomas in patients receiving PUVA is reviewed. During 13,224 person-years of prospective follow-up of 1380 patients enrolled in the PUVA follow-up study, three melanomas were diagnosed, which does not differ significantly from the expected rate (relative risk = 1.5 with 90% confidence interval 0.3 to 7.3). However, considering the effects of PUVA on melanocytes and that the development of melanomas may have a long latent period, continued follow-up studies are indicated.",

        "abstract": "The self-induced dermatoses represent about 2% of dermatology patient visits, and include the recurrent body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRB) (skin-picking or excoriation disorder, trichotillomania, onychophagia and onychotillomania), dermatitis artefacta, and features of other psychiatric disorders, for example, secondary to excessive grooming in body dysmorphic disorder, skin picking in delusional infestation, or secondary to self-harm in depressive disease. Among the BFRBs, onychophagia and onychotillomania are most likely to be associated with lesions that mimic other dermatologic conditions (eg, nail psoriasis, lichen planus, vasculitis, onychomycosis, melanoma). Dermatitis artefacta (DA) describes lesions that are self-inflicted with the intention of assuming a sick role in the absence of obvious external rewards. DA lesions can be bizarre-appearing or may be created intentionally to mimic dermatologic disease (eg, Munchausen syndrome). The manipulation of the integument can have a focused obsessive-compulsive behavioral style which is more responsive to the standard behavior therapies, or an impulsive-dissociative style where patients have partial or no recollection of having self-induced their lesion; dissociative patients tend to have more severe BFRBs and DA, and greater psychopathology. Self-induced dermatoses may both imitate and co-occur with primary dermatologic disease, and may not be readily identified unless the clinician maintains an index of suspicion.",

        "abstract": "Computerized nail planimetry is an objective means of accurately assessing affected nail areas, versus the standard visual estimation method. However, no published comparison of visual assessment with planimetry is currently available on onychomycosis to support this recommendation. Objectives: This article evaluates efficacy based on visual assessment compared to planimetry measures during the course of an 84-week large-scale, single-site trial of subungual dermatophyte onychomycosis, to determine the validity of planimetry versus visual assessment. Methods: Visually assessed percentage of affected area of the target toenail was compared with planimetry calculated measurements made from digital photographs. Results: Comparison showed good statistical agreement of visual and planimetry measures based on correlation coefficient. Visual and planimetry assessments at week 84 were within 10% of each other in 92% of cases, and within 5% of each other in 74% of comparisons. However, errors in visual assessment artificially inflated the cure rates by 9% and 11% at weeks 84 and 48, respectively. Furthermore, the significant difference in effective cure between regimens using visual methods loses significance when planimetry measures are used. Conclusions: The results suggest that objective measures such as planimetry will reduce the impact of visual assessment errors, and techniques to increase the standardization of onychomycosis assessment are warranted.",

        "abstract": "The impact of psoriasis upon the quality of life contributes significantly to the overall morbidity associated with the disease. An older age at onset of psoriasis and being a man have been associated previously with lower psychosocial morbidity. In order to further evaluate these potentially important mitigating factors, we examined the relation of age and gender on some aspects of psoriasis-related psychosocial morbidity. Two hundred and fifteen consenting psoriasis patients, representing a wide range of disease severity, were studied. They included 110 men and 105 women, age range 19-87 years (age: mean +/- SD: 48.0 +/- 15.9 years); all endorsed a list of 30 items (by checking a \"Yes\" or \"No\") pertaining to life events related to psoriasis that they had experienced in the previous one month. The patients self-rated the severity of their psoriasis. The patients were categorized into four age groups of 18-29 years (N = 28), 30-45 years (N = 77), 46-65 years (N = 76), and > 65 years (N = 34), respectively, for the statistical analyses. No age or gender differences in the severity of psoriasis were observed. Patients of both sexes in the 18 to 29 and 30 to 45 year age groups reported more frequent (P < or = 0.05) problems related to both appearance/socialization and occupation/finances, in contrast to patients in the 46-65 and over-65-year age groups. No gender differences (P < or = 0.05) were observed in the frequency of items related to appearance and socialization; however, men reported greater work-related stresses. Psoriasis has a greater impact upon the quality of life of patients in the 18 to 45 year age range and affects the socialization of both sexes equally. Men face greater work-related stresses as a result of their psoriasis.",

It inhibits ergosterol biosynthesis enzyme sterol 14α-demethylase. Efinaconazole has lower minimum inhibitory concentrations than terbinafine, ciclopirox, itraconazole and amorolfine in Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Candida albicans. The solution based formula has low surface tension and keratin binding properties that increase penetrance through the nail plate. Safety studies have shown that this formulation is not associated with atopic dermatitis or contact sensitivity. Duplicate Phase III clinical trials in adults with mild to moderate distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis indicate that efinaconazole 10% solution is an effective therapy with a pooled complete cure rate of 17% and a pooled mycological cure rate of 54%. Efinaconazole 10% nail solution is a safe and effective new topical therapy for onychomycosis, which will fill a pressing need for more effective topical therapy in this disease.",

        "title": "Prevalence and epidemiology of unsuspected onychomycosis in patients visiting dermatologists' offices in Ontario Canada - A multicenter survey of 2001 patients",
        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Questionnaire studies have been used to determine the prevalence of onychomycosis in the United Kingdom and Europe. One disadvantage of this methodology is that the patient self‐diagnoses the onychomycosis. There have been very few large studies involving clinical examination of the nails of subjects, followed by mycological confirmation of the onychomycosis. We therefore determined the prevalence of onychomycosis in patients visiting dermatologists' offices in Ontario, Canada. In a prospective, multicenter study, the finger‐ and toenails of all new patients presenting to dermatologists' offices were examined by a board‐certified dermatologist. If there was clinical suspicion of onychomycosis, then nail samples were obtained for mycoiogical examination at a central laboratory. Patients referred specifically for the management of onychomycosis were excluded. Toenails appeared abnormal in 455 (22.7%) of 2001 patients. Mycologically‐confirmed pedal onychomycosis was present in 182 (9.1%) of the 2001 patients. The estimated value of the prevalence of onychomycosis in Ontario is 6.86% (95% confidence interval (Cl): 5.8–8.0%), when corrected for age and sex of the general population using census data. Onychomycosis increased with age (P < 0.0001). The odds of males having onychomycosis was 84.3% greater than females of the same age (P = 0.0003). The distribution of organisms in the 141 patients with pedal onychomycosis who were culture positive was: dermatophytes 131 (92.9%), Candida species 4 (2.8%) and non‐dermatophyte molds 6 (4.3%). The prevalence of mycologically‐confirmed toenail onychomycosis was 9.1%, with the estimated prevalence in Ontario being 6.86%. The majority of patients with abnormal‐appearing nails were unaware they might have onychomycosis, that it is infectious and potentially treatable, suggesting that there is potential for increased public awareness and education.",

While 5% minoxidil foam has been approved for men since 2006, Health Canada and the FDA only approved 5% minoxidil foam for female pattern hair loss (FPHL) in 2014. Recent Phase III clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of once daily 5% minoxidil foam for treatment of FPHL, where a significant change from baseline in the target area hair count was observed compared to placebo. Similar changes in hair count for 5% foam and twice daily 2% minoxidil solution established noninferiority of the 5% foam formulation. Five percent minoxidil foam provides an additional option for women with FPHL and will soon be available in Canada.",

We present the case of a patient with bulimia who reported that the negative effect of acne on her appearance increased her body image concerns and exacerbated her eating disorder. Improvement of the acne was associated with a significant improvement in her eating disorder. Eating disordered patients may go on restrictive diets in order to control their acne since levels of androgens, which are one of the primary stimulants of sebaceous gland activity, are lower in starvation. As a significant number of adolescents with eating disorders also develop acne, it is important for the clinician to be aware of this previously unreported association between acne and eating disorders, and to evaluate the impact of acne upon the patient's body image and eating behaviour.",

It has a favorable benefit-risk ratio, with an inflammatory action similar to that of a medium potency corticosteroid, but with a low potential to cause skin atrophy. Thus, prednicarbate may be a consideration in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in children, and other inflammatory disorders in children and adults.",

        "abstract": "This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention). The objectives are as follows: To assess the effects of topical treatments for athlete's foot (interdigital tinea pedis) caused by dermatophytes. Tinea pedis ‐ or athlete's foot ‐ is a superficial inflammatory infection of the skin of the feet caused by dermatophyte fungi. Among the fungi responsible for athlete's foot are Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, and Epidermophyton floccosum (Hsu 2012; Rinaldi 2000). There are three clinical subtypes of athlete's foot: interdigital, moccasin, and vesiculobullous, with interdigital being the most common (Hsu 2012). This review will focus specifically on the subtype interdigital tinea pedis. The name 'athlete's foot' was derived from the increased occurrence of the condition among athletes, because of their use of occlusive footwear, which create the ideal conditions for dermatophyte reproduction (Macura 1993). Athlete's foot is characterised by whitish macerated skin and itchy or asymptomatic erythema between the toes, usually in the fourth and fifth spaces. Blisters and cracks in the skin between the toes may cause pain and inflammation of the exposed raw tissue. A concomitant bacterial infection may also be present and require antibiotic treatment. Athlete's foot is typically diagnosed by visual inspection of the lesions, microscopy, and cell culture (Rotta 2012) and may be differentially diagnosed as bacterial or candidal intertrigo, dermatitis, eczema, idiopathic keratoderma, or psoriasis (Rinaldi 2000).",

        "organization": "Professor University of Toronto",
        "abstract": "Onychomycosis can be investigated by sampling. Information gleaned includes nail bed involvement, nail plate penetration, fungal viability, and species identification. Testing samples can confirm a diagnosis. While diagnostic testing is considered useful in directing therapy, a substantial number of clinicians do not confirm diagnosis prior to treatment. The aim of this study is to quantify the benefit of confirmatory testing prior to treating toenail onychomycosis. The cost of mycological cure (negative potassium hydroxide and negative culture) and the cost-effectiveness of confirmatory testing were determined using the average cost of potassium hydroxide (KOH), culture, periodic acid–Schiff (PAS), efinaconazole, ciclopirox, terbinafine, and itraconazole. Costs were obtained through literature searches, public domain websites, and telephone surveys to local pharmacies and laboratories. To represent the potential risks of prescribing onychomycosis treatment, the costs associated with liver monitoring, potential life-threatening adverse events, and drug-drug interactions were obtained through public domain websites, published studies, and product inserts. PAS was determined to be the most sensitive confirmatory test and KOH the least expensive. The overall cost of an incorrect diagnosis (no confirmatory test used) ranged between $350 and $1175 CAD per patient for treatment of 3 infected toenails. Comparatively, performing confirmatory testing prior to treatment decreases the overall cost to $320 to $930, depending on the therapy, physician, and test. It is preferred to diagnose onychomycosis prior to treatment. Furthermore, there are cost savings when confirmatory testing is performed before initiating treatment with both topical and oral antifungals in Canada.",

        "abstract": "Onychomycosis has several clinical presentations and is caused by various infectious organisms. To provide guidance for selection of appropriate treatment. The literature on onychomycosis management was reviewed to generate an evidence-based decision tree. Several options are available: terbinafine, itraconazole, fluconazole, ciclopirox 8% nail lacquer, efinaconazole 10% nail solution, and laser therapy. Further studies on lasers are needed before use can be recommended. Nondermatophyte molds or mixed infection can be managed with terbinafine or itraconazole with or without topicals. Itraconazole, fluconazole, and efinaconazole can be used for Candida infection. For dermatophytes, topicals can be considered for mild to moderate onychomycosis. For moderate to severe cases, any oral monotherapy can be used; however, we suggest terbinafine if there is a possibility of a drug interaction. These recommendations can be applied for all ages, immune function, or metabolic status, but proper monitoring and contraindications should be taken into consideration.",

This disorder typically runs a chronic course. In addition to symptomatic dermatologic treatments for the self-inflicted excoriations and secondary pruritus, the treatment for this disorder is primarily psychiatric. In spite of this, neurotic excoriation has received little attention in the psychiatric literature, probably reflecting a lack of adequate collaboration between the dermatologist and the psychiatrist. This article critically reviews the literature on this disorder, and presents the salient features of five consecutive cases seen at the psychiatry-dermatology liaison clinic at our hospital. Possible etiology and treatment strategies in a previously unreported subgroup of patients with seemingly intractable symptoms are discussed. Further, the review highlights the fact that knowledge of this symptom complex is important for all psychiatrists, since it is frequently a \"cutaneous sign\" of psychopathology.",

Group 1, comprising 21 psoriatic patients, was treated with 14 mg/kg per day of oral cyclosporine for 4 weeks in a prospective, placebo-controlled study; group 2, comprising 28 patients with diverse cutaneous diseases, was given 6 mg/kg per day of oral cyclosporine for 1 to 3 months in a prospective, open-labeled study. Renal function (determined by serum urea nitrogen [SUN] and creatinine levels and urinalysis), BP, serum electrolyte levels (potassium and magnesium), and urate level were measured weekly for the first 4 weeks in both groups, and then, after 2 and 3 months of therapy, in group 2 only. During the first 4 weeks in group 1 patients, there were significant increases in values of SUN, creatinine, BP, potassium, and urate, and a significant decrease in the serum magnesium value. When data for the two groups were combined, the changes from pretherapy values in each of the above measures (except systolic BP) during the first 4 weeks correlated significantly with cyclosporine trough levels. In group 2, the changes that occurred in the first 4 weeks in the SUN value, SUN/creatinine ratio, and BP were magnified over the subsequent 8 weeks of treatment. In the combined group for the first 4 weeks of therapy, duration of therapy, independent of cyclosporine trough levels, correlated with changes in SUN, creatinine, and urate levels, but not with changes in the potassium or magnesium level or in BP. We conclude that the cyclosporine blood level was a better discriminant than cyclosporine dosage in the analysis of renal dysfunction and hypertension in these patients.",
