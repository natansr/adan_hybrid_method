        "abstract": "Cross-ratio (CR) based methods offer many attractive properties for remote gaze estimation using a single camera in an uncalibrated setup by exploiting invariance of a plane projectivity. Unfortunately, due to several simplification assumptions, the performance of CR-based eye gaze trackers decays significantly as the subject moves away from the calibration position. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive homography mapping for achieving gaze prediction with higher accuracy at the calibration position and more robustness under head movements. This is achieved with a learning-based method for compensating both spatially-varying gaze errors and head pose dependent errors simultaneously in a unified framework. The model of adaptive homography is trained offline using simulated data, saving a tremendous amount of time in data collection. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using both simulated and real data from a physical setup. We show that our method compares favorably against other state-of-the-art CR based methods.",

        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "A novel framework for text-independent speaker verification is proposed. The framework is based on a new interpretation of Universal Background Model. The UBM in our framework actually defines a transform which maps the variable length observation into a fixed dimensional supervector(supervector space). Each speech utterance is then mapped into a point in this supervector space. The similarity measure in this vector space is progressively refined via an iterative cohort modeling scheme. The experiments on NIST 2002 corpus show the effectiveness of this new framework. Overall the EER drops from the baseline system(with T-Norm) 9.21% to final improved system(without T-Norm) 8.07%. The new framework can effectively reduce the data dependence in the final output score which is clearly indicated in the second sets of experiments. The EER after T-Norm of final system marginally increases by relatively 1.73% compared to the EER of baseline system drops 16.12% relatively after T-Norm. Also, the relative improvement of DCF after T-Norm is marginal for the final improved system (2.47%) compared to 33.68% in baseline system. It clear shows that the iterative cohort modeling effectively reduce the data dependence of the final scores, so that T-Norm will not further improve the system performance. Also, the performance of novel frame clearly increases as the iteration grows which suggest that the framework progressively refine the similarity measure on the supervector space with the iterative cohort modeling.",

        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "This paper proposes a semantic representation, pose lexicon, for action recognition. The lexicon is composed of a set of semantic poses, a set of visual poses and a probabilistic mapping between the visual and semantic poses. Specially, an action can be represented by a sequence of semantic poses extracted from an associated textual instruction. Visual frames of the action are considered to be generated from a sequence of hidden visual poses. To learn the lexicon, a visual pose model is learned from training samples by a Gaussian Mixture model to characterize the likelihood of an observed visual frame being generated by a visual pose. A pose lexicon model is also learned by an extended hidden Markov alignment model to encode the probabilistic mapping between hidden visual poses and semantic poses sequences. With the lexicon, action classification is formulated as a problem of finding the maximum posterior probability of a given sequence of visual frames that fits to a given sequence of semantic poses through the most likely visual pose and alignment sequences. The efficacy of the proposed method was evaluated on MSRC-12, WorkoutSU-10, WorkoutUOW-18, Combined-15 and Combined-17 action datasets using cross-subject, cross-dataset and zero-shot protocols.",

        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "The cross-ratio approach has recently attracted increasing attention in eye-gaze tracking due to its simplicity in setting up a tracking system. Its accuracy, however, is lower than that of the model-based approach, and substantial efforts have been devoted to improving its accuracy. Binocular fixation is essential for humans to have good depth perception, and this paper presents a technique leveraging this constraint. It is used in two ways: First, in estimating jointly the homography matrices for both eyes, and second, in estimating the eye gaze itself. Experimental results with both synthetic and real data show that the proposed approach produces significantly better results than using a single eye and also better than averaging the independent results from the two eyes.",

        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "In recent years, we have witnessed the rapid growth of research in visual understanding with RGB-D sensors since the release of Micrsoft’s Kinect sensor in November 2010. For a long time, researchers have been challenged by many visual understanding problems such as detecting and identifying objects or human activities in real-world situations. Traditional segmentation and tracking algorithms are not always reliable when the environment is cluttered or the illumination changes suddenly. However, the effective combination of depth and RGB data can alleviate the negative effects of environmental changes, thus improving the accuracy of object identification and tracking. The freely available online Kinect SDKs and pose trackers for environment modeling further encourage novel solutions to traditional visual understanding problems. However, Kinect sensors face a number of specific challenges, such as missing or corrupted depth pixels and inaccurate calibration between depth and RGB cameras. This special issue is specifically dedicated to new algorithms and applications based on the Kinect sensors.",

        "abstract": "Commodity depth cameras have created many interesting new applications in the research community recently. These applications often require the calibration information between the color and the depth cameras. Traditional checkerboard-based calibration schemes fail to work well for the depth camera, since its corner features cannot be reliably detected in the depth image. In this chapter, we present a maximum likelihood solution for the joint depth and color calibration based on two principles. First, in the depth image, points on the checkerboard shall be coplanar, and the plane is known from color camera calibration. Second, additional point correspondences between the depth and color images may be manually specified or automatically established to help improve calibration accuracy. Uncertainty in depth values has been taken into account systematically. The proposed algorithm is reliable and accurate, as demonstrated by extensive experimental results on simulated and real-world examples.",

        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "Estimating room impulse responses (RIRs) has a number of applications, including personalized audio, analyzing and improving acoustic behavior of concert halls, listening room compensation, sound source localization, and many others. RIRs have been estimated in essentially the same fashion for the last 50 years: Compute the cross correlation between a signal played at point A, and the signal received at point B. Best results are obtained when the signal played is white noise, or a maximum length sequence. No prior knowledge is exploited in computing the RIR, which is simply assumed to be the cross correlation between played and received signals. In contrast, research in adaptive RIR estimation (a.k.a. adaptive Acoustic Echo Cancellation) has made huge progress by (among other things) incorporating models for the RIR. In this paper we propose a new RIR estimation technique, based on a maximum a posteriori formulation. More specifically, we estimate the room reverberation time, as well as the room noise level, and use those as priors for the RIR estimation. Comparison with ground truth shows an average improvement of 12 dB compared to traditional methods.",

        "abstract": "Multiview face detection is a challenging problem due to dramatic appearance changes under various pose, illumination and expression conditions. In this paper, we present a multi-task deep learning scheme to enhance the detection performance. More specifically, we build a deep convolutional neural network that can simultaneously learn the face/nonface decision, the face pose estimation problem, and the facial landmark localization problem. We show that such a multi-task learning scheme can further improve the classifier's accuracy. On the challenging FDDB data set, our detector achieves over 3% improvement in detection rate at the same false positive rate compared with other state-of-the-art methods.",

        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "The recently developed depth sensors, e.g., the Kinect sensor, have provided new opportunities for human-computer interaction (HCI). Although great progress has been made by leveraging the Kinect sensor, e.g., in human body tracking, face recognition and human action recognition, robust hand gesture recognition remains an open problem. Compared to the entire human body, the hand is a smaller object with more complex articulations and more easily affected by segmentation errors. It is thus a very challenging problem to recognize hand gestures. This paper focuses on building a robust part-based hand gesture recognition system using Kinect sensor. To handle the noisy hand shapes obtained from the Kinect sensor, we propose a novel distance metric, Finger-Earth Mover's Distance (FEMD), to measure the dissimilarity between hand shapes. As it only matches the finger parts while not the whole hand, it can better distinguish the hand gestures of slight differences. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our hand gesture recognition system is accurate (a 93.2% mean accuracy on a challenging 10-gesture dataset), efficient (average 0.0750 s per frame), robust to hand articulations, distortions and orientation or scale changes, and can work in uncontrolled environments (cluttered backgrounds and lighting conditions). The superiority of our system is further demonstrated in two real-life HCI applications.",

This also provides spatial audio reproduction for multiparty teleconferencing such that the teleconferencing participants perceive themselves as if they were sitting in the same room. The solution is based on the premise that people perceive sounds as a reconstructed wavefront, and hence, the wavefronts are used to provide the spatial perceptual cues. The differences between the spatial perceptual cues derived from the reconstructed wavefront of sound waves and the ideal wavefront of sound waves form an objective metric for spatial perceptual quality, and provide the means of evaluating the overall system performance. Additionally, compensation filters are employed to improve the spatial perceptual quality of stereophonic systems by optimizing the objective metrics.",

A representation of a harmonic component of the frame is synthesized and used to compute a non-harmonic component of the frame. The synthesized harmonic component representation and the non-harmonic component are then used to compute a harmonic to non-harmonic ratio (HnHR). This HnHR is indicative of the quality of a user's speech and is designated as an estimate of the speech quality of the frame. In one implementation, the HnHR is used to establish a minimum speech quality threshold below which the quality of the user's speech is considered unacceptable.

        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "The cost of autonomous development is substantial. Although supervised learning is effective, the cost demand on teachers is often too high to be constantly applied. Reinforcement learning can take advantage of physical reality due to environmental feedback and inspections. Information required in reinforcement learning is not as specific as is required in supervised learning. Integration theories, methods, and analysis of these two learning strategies are still rare in the literature although such integration has been well known in the animal kingdom. Based on our prior work on a general purpose framework called Developmental Network and its embodiment Where-What-Network, we present our theory, method, and analysis for integration of supervised learning and reinforcement learning in this paper. Different from all other known work on reinforcement learning, this DN framework uses fully emergent representation to avoid the brittleness and task-specific representations. Central in the integration is not just to provide a freedom for the teacher to choose the mode of learning, which is necessary especially when the physical non-living world is an implicit teacher, but the mechanism of scaffolding. In our experiment the scaffolding is reflected by allowing the location motor(LM) neurons to gradually refine representation through splitting(mitosis) in a coarse to fine scheme. We report our experimental work in a very challenging learning setting: both object and backgrounds are unknown(cluttered settings) and concepts(e.g. location and type) emerge from agent-environment interactions, instead of rigidly handcrafted.",

        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "In consumer video conferencing, lighting conditions are usually not ideal thus the image qualities are poor. Lighting affects image quality on two aspects: brightness and skin tone. While there has been much research on improving the brightness of the captured images including contrast enhancement and noise removal (which can be thought of as components for brightness improvement), little attention has been paid to the skin tone aspect. In contrast, it is a common knowledge for professional stage lighting designers that lighting affects not only the brightness but also the color tone which plays a critical role in the perceived look of the host and the mood of the stage scene. Inspired by stage lighting design, we propose an active lighting system which automatically adjusts the lighting so that the image looks visually appealing. The system consists of computer controllable light emitting diode light sources of different colors so that it improves not only the brightness but also the skin tone of the face. Given that there is no quantitative formula on what makes a good skin tone, we use a data driven approach to learn a good skin tone model from a collection of photographs taken by professional photographers. We have developed a working system and conducted user studies to validate our approach.",

        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "Head-mounted displays (HMDs) have gained more and more interest recently. They can enable people to communicate with each other from anywhere, at anytime. However, since most HMDs today are only equipped with cameras pointing outwards, the remote party would not be able to see the user wearing the HMD. In this paper, we present a system for facial expression tracking based on head-mounted, inward looking cameras, such that the user can be represented with animated avatars at the remote party. The main challenge is that the cameras can only observe partial faces since they are very close to the face. We experiment with multiple machine learning algorithms to estimate facial expression parameters based on training data collected with the assistance of a Kinect depth sensor. Our results show that we can reliably track people's facial expression even from very limited view angles of the cameras.",

        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "In the realm of multi-modal visual recognition, the reliability of the data acquisition system is often a concern due to the increased complexity of the sensors. One of the major issues is the accidental loss of one or more sensing channels, which poses a major challenge to current learning systems. In this paper, we examine one of these specific missing data problems, where we have a main modality/view along with an auxiliary modality/view present in the training data, but merely the main modality/view in the test data. To effectively leverage the auxiliary information to train a stronger classifier, we propose a collaborative auxiliary learning framework based on a new discriminative canonical correlation analysis. This framework reveals a common semantic space shared across both modalities/views through enforcing a series of nonlinear projections. Such projections automatically embed the discriminative cues hidden in both modalities/views into the common space, and better visual recognition is thus achieved on the test data. The efficacy of our proposed auxiliary learning approach is demonstrated through four challenging visual recognition tasks with different kinds of auxiliary information.",

Our approach consists of a coarse-to-fine voxel representation and a collection of parallel processing steps. Voxels are stored as a list of unsigned integer triples. An oracle kernel decides, for each voxel in parallel, whether to keep or cull its voxel from the list based on an image consistency criterion of its projection across cameras. After a prefix sum scan, kept voxels are subdivided and the process repeats until projected voxels are pixel size. These voxels are drawn to a render target and shaded as a weighted combination of their projections into a set of calibrated RGB images. We apply this technique to the problem of smooth visual hull reconstruction of human subjects based on a set of live image streams. We demonstrate that human upper body shapes can be reconstructed to giga voxel resolution at greater than 30 fps on modern graphics hardware.",

Embodiments of the system and method use temporal information of the scene captured previously to obtain a total history. This total history is warped onto information captured by a camera at a current time in order to help reconstruct the dis-occluded areas. The historical data (or frames) from the total history match only a portion of the frames contained in the captured information. This warping yields warped history information. Warping is performed by using one of two embodiments to match points in an estimation of the current information to points in the captured information. Next, regions of current information are split using a classifier. The warped history information and the captured information then are merged to obtain an estimate for the current information and the reconstructed virtual view.",

        "abstract": "We examine an under-explored visual recognition problem, where we have a main view along with an auxiliary view of visual information present in the training data, but merely the main view is available in the test data. To effectively leverage the auxiliary view to train a stronger classifier, we propose a collaborative auxiliary learning framework based on a new discriminative canonical correlation analysis. This framework reveals a common semantic space shared across both views through enforcing a series of nonlinear projections. Such projections automatically embed the discriminative cues hidden in both views into the common space, and better visual recognition is thus achieved on the test data that stems from only the main view. The efficacy of our proposed auxiliary learning approach is demonstrated through three challenging visual recognition tasks with different kinds of auxiliary information.",

        "title": "Handling Occlusion and Large Displacement Through Improved RGB-D Scene Flow Estimation",
        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "The accuracy of scene flow is restricted by several challenges such as occlusion and large displacement motion. When occlusion happens, the positions inside the occluded regions lose their corresponding counterparts in preceding and succeeding frames. Large displacement motion will increase the complexity of motion modeling and computation. Moreover, occlusion and large displacement motion are highly related problems in scene flow estimation, e.g., large displacement motion often leads to considerably occluded regions in the scene. An improved dense scene flow method based on red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) data is proposed in this paper. To handle occlusion, we model the occlusion status for each point in our problem formulation, and jointly estimate the scene flow and occluded regions. To deal with large displacement motion, we employ an over-parameterized scene flow representation to model both the rotation and translation components of the scene flow, since large displacement motion cannot be well approximated using translational motion only. Furthermore, we employ a two-stage optimization procedure for this overparameterized scene flow representation. In the first stage, we propose a new RGB-D PatchMatch method, which is mainly applied in the RGB-D image space to reduce the computational complexity introduced by the large displacement motion. According to the quantitative evaluation based on the Middlebury data set, our method outperforms other published methods. The improved performance is also comprehensively confirmed on the real data acquired by Kinect sensor.",

        "abstract": "Computer vision is a key branch of artificial intelligence, aiming at understanding the surrounding environment from the visual information captured by cameras. 3D computer vision is a subfield of computer vision that focuses on extracting 3D metric information from 2D images. This is a very challenging task since what we have in an image is the projection of a 3D scene, whose depth information is lost during image formation (image projection). However, it has many important applications such as the following:  Robot/Car/Drone/Visually-impaired Navigation. 3D information is needed in this application for obstacle avoidance, free space determination, and pose estimation.  Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). 3D computer vision is crucial for VR/AR. This includes camera pose estimation for head-mounted displays, 3D modeling for VR/AR contents, and seamless integration of virtual objects into the real world.  Human-Computer/Robot Interaction. 3D computer vision allows the computer/robot to see the user, understand the user’s non-verbal body language (gesture, body posture, facial expression, etc.), and interact in natural ways such as gesture and speech, instead of the traditional keyboard and mouse.",

        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "Conventional scene flow containing only translational vectors is not able to model 3D motion with rotation properly. Moreover, the accuracy of 3D motion estimation is restricted by several challenges such as large displacement, noise, and missing data (caused by sensing techniques or occlusion). In terms of solution, there are two kinds of approaches: local approaches and global approaches. However, local approaches can not generate smooth motion field, and global approaches is difficult to handle large displacement motion. In this paper, a completed dense scene flow framework is proposed, which models both rotation and translation for general motion estimation. It combines both a local method and a global method considering their complementary characteristics to handle large displacement motion and enforce smoothness respectively. The proposed framework is applied on the RGB-D image space where the computation efficiency is further improved. According to the quantitative evaluation based on Middlebury dataset, our method outperforms other published methods. The improved performance is further confirmed on the real data acquired by Kinect sensor.",

        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "A novel method for semantic action recognition through learning a pose lexicon is presented in this paper. A pose lexicon comprises a set of semantic poses, a set of visual poses, and a probabilistic mapping between the visual and semantic poses. This paper assumes that both the visual poses and mapping are hidden and proposes a method to simultaneously learn a visual pose model that estimates the likelihood of an observed video frame being generated from hidden visual poses, and a pose lexicon model establishes the probabilistic mapping between the hidden visual poses and the semantic poses parsed from textual instructions. Specifically, the proposed method consists of two-level hidden Markov models. One level represents the alignment between the visual poses and semantic poses. The other level represents a visual pose sequence, and each visual pose is modeled as a Gaussian mixture. An expectation-maximization algorithm is developed to train a pose lexicon. With the learned lexicon, action classification is formulated as a problem of finding the maximum posterior probability of a given sequence of video frames that follows a given sequence of semantic poses, constrained by the most likely visual pose and the alignment sequences. The proposed method was evaluated on MSRC-12, WorkoutSU-10, WorkoutUOW-18, Combined-15, Combined-17, and Combined-50 action datasets using cross-subject, cross-dataset, zero-shot, and seen/unseen protocols.",

        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "This paper presents two vision-based interface systems. The first, Visual Screen, uses an inexpensive technique to transform an ordinary screen into a touch screen using an ordinary camera. The setup is easy: position a camera so it can see the whole screen. The system calibration involves the detection of the screen region in the image, which determines the projective mapping between the image plane and the screen. In runtime, our system locates the tip pointer (fingertip in our current implementation) in the image and converts the image position to the cursor position on the screen. The second system, Visual Panel, extends the previous system for mobile applications. It employs an arbitrary quadrangle-shaped panel (e.g., an ordinary piece of paper) and a tip pointer as an intuitive, wireless and mobile input device. The system can accurately and reliably track the panel and the tip pointer. The panel tracking continuously determines the projective mapping between the panel at the current position and the display, which in turn maps the tip position to the corresponding position on the display. The system can fulfill many tasks such as controlling a remote large display, and simulating a physical keyboard. Users can naturally use their fingers or other tip pointers to issue commands and type texts. Furthermore, by tracking the 3D position and orientation of the visual panel, the system can also provide 3D information, serving as a virtual joystick, to control 3D virtual objects.",

This paper addresses this problem by using a sharp near-infrared (NIR) image when the environment has sufficient NIR light. We assume that an RGB and NIR image pair has a linear mapping in a local area and that the mapping function is valid for both the blur and sharp image pairs. Using this property, we solve the sharp RGB images from a blurred RGB image and the corres ponding s harp NIR image.

        "abstract": "We propose a new technique for tracking based on side statistics and maximum discriminant analysis. The object to be tracked is modeled by a set of sample points on the boundary together with image statistics inside the object. Tracking is conducted by maximizing the discrimination between the object and the background, based on an adapted Kullback-Leibler divergence without knowing the statistics of the background. Since no knowledge of the background is required, our technique is particularly useful in dynamic environments where the background can change substantially during the performance of a visual task, or when a system needs to be deployed in different environments. Because we use both the side statistics and the boundary information, our method is more robust than the traditional approaches that use either just boundaries or just regions. As will be shown experimentally, our technique can deal with complex environment, changing background, and partial occlusion, and it is real-time and accurate. We have used the technique to track a panel such as a piece of paper in an application system called VISUAL PANEL which serves as a wireless mobile input device to a computer.",

        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "Face detection is one of the most studied topics in computer vision literature, not only because of the challenging nature of face as an object, but also due to the countless applications that require the application of face detection as a first step. During the past 15 years, tremendous progress has been made due to the availability of data in unconstrained capture conditions (so-called ‘in-the-wild’) through the Internet, the effort made by the community to develop publicly available benchmarks, as well as the progress in the development of robust computer vision algorithms. In this paper, we survey the recent advances in real-world face detection techniques, beginning with the seminal Viola–Jones face detector methodology. These techniques are roughly categorized into two general schemes: rigid templates, learned mainly via boosting based methods or by the application of deep neural networks, and deformable models that describe the face by its parts. Representative methods will be described in detail, along with a few additional successful methods that we briefly go through at the end. Finally, we survey the main databases used for the evaluation of face detection algorithms and recent benchmarking efforts, and discuss the future of face detection.",

        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "We propose a system that augments touch input with visual understanding of the user to improve interaction with a large touch-sensitive display. A commodity color plus depth sensor such as Microsoft Kinect adds the visual modality and enables new interactions beyond touch. Through visual analysis, the system understands where the user is, who the user is, and what the user is doing even before the user touches the display. Such information is used to enhance interaction in multiple ways. For example, a user can use simple gestures to bring up menu items such as color palette and soft keyboard; menu items can be shown where the user is and can follow the user; hovering can show information to the user before the user commits to touch; the user can perform different functions (for example writing and erasing) with different hands; and the user's preference profile can be maintained, distinct from other users. User studies are conducted and the users very much appreciate the value of these and other enhanced interactions. ",

        "title": "Dimension Reduction With Extreme Learning Machine",
        "organization": "Tencent Robotics X",
        "abstract": "Data may often contain noise or irrelevant information, which negatively affect the generalization capability of machine learning algorithms. The objective of dimension reduction algorithms, such as principal component analysis (PCA), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), random projection (RP), and auto-encoder (AE), is to reduce the noise or irrelevant information of the data. The features of PCA (eigenvectors) and linear AE are not able to represent data as parts (e.g. nose in a face image). On the other hand, NMF and non-linear AE are maimed by slow learning speed and RP only represents a subspace of original data. This paper introduces a dimension reduction framework which to some extend represents data as parts, has fast learning speed, and learns the between-class scatter subspace. To this end, this paper investigates a linear and non-linear dimension reduction framework referred to as extreme learning machine AE (ELM-AE) and sparse ELM-AE (SELM-AE). In contrast to tied weight AE, the hidden neurons in ELM-AE and SELM-AE need not be tuned, and their parameters (e.g, input weights in additive neurons) are initialized using orthogonal and sparse random weights, respectively. Experimental results on USPS handwritten digit recognition data set, CIFAR-10 object recognition, and NORB object recognition data set show the efficacy of linear and non-linear ELM-AE and SELM-AE in terms of discriminative capability, sparsity, training time, and normalized mean square error.",

        "abstract": "We propose deeply-supervised nets (DSN), a method that simultaneously minimizes classification error and improves the directness and transparency of the hidden layer learning process. We focus our attention on three aspects of traditional convolutional-neuralnetwork-type (CNN-type) architectures: (1) transparency in the effect intermediate layers have on overall classification; (2) discriminativeness and robustness of learned features, especially in early layers; (3) training effectiveness in the face of “vanishing” gradients. To combat these issues, we introduce “companion” objective functions at each hidden layer, in addition to the overall objective function at the output layer (an integrated strategy distinct from layer-wise pretraining). We also analyze our algorithm using techniques extended from stochastic gradient methods. The advantages provided by our method are evident in our experimental results, showing state-of-the-art performance on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.",

        "abstract": "Most commercial eye gaze tracking systems are based on the use of infrared lights. However, such systems may not work outdoor or may have a very limited head box for them to work. This paper proposes a non-infrared based approach to track one's eye gaze with an RGBD camera (in our case, Kinect). The proposed method adopts a personalized 3D face model constructed off-line. To detect the eye gaze, our system tracks the iris center and a set of 2D facial landmarks whose 3D locations are provided by the RGBD camera. A simple onetime calibration procedure is used to obtain the parameters of the personalized eye gaze model. We compare the performance of the proposed method against the 2D approach using only RGB input on the same images, and find that the use of depth information directly from Kinect achieves more accurate tracking. As expected, the results from the proposed method are not as accurate as the ones from infrared-based approaches. However, this method has the potential for practical use with upcoming better and cheaper depth cameras.",

Interest points are detected, e.g., as 2D Harris corners with recent motion, e.g. locations with high intensities in a motion history image (MHI). A global spatial motion smoothing filter is applied to the gradients of MHI to eliminate low intensity corners that are likely isolated, unreliable or noisy motions. At each remaining interest point, a local motion field filter is applied to the smoothed gradients by computing a structure proximity between sets of pixels in the local region and the interest point. The motion at a pixel/pixel set is enhanced or weakened based on its structure proximity with the interest point (nearer pixels are enhanced).",
