        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) outbreaks in men who have sex with men (MSM) have been associated with meningococcal colonisation of the urethra and rectum, but little is known about this colonisation or co-colonisation with the closely related gonococcus. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was employed to explore these phenomena. Meningococci isolated from the urogenital tract and rectum (n=23) and coincident gonococci (n=14) were analysed by WGS along with contemporary meningococci from IMD (n=11). All isolates were obtained from hospital admissions in Brighton, UK, 2011–2013. Assembled WGS were deposited in the PubMLST/neisseria database (http://pubmlst.org/neisseria) and compared at genomic loci common to gonococci or meningococci. As expected, most meningococci from IMD were encapsulated and belonged to hyperinvasive lineages. So too were meningococci found in the urogenital tract and rectum, contrasting to those asymptomatically carried in the nasopharynx where such meningococci are rare. Five hyperinvasive meningococcal lineages and four distinct gonococcal genotypes were recovered, including multiresistant ST-1901 (NG MAST-1407) gonococci. These data were consistent with a predisposition for potentially virulent encapsulated hyperinvasive meningococci to colonise the urethra and rectum, which suggests their involvement in MSM IMD outbreaks. The coincidence of multiresistant gonococci raises wider public health concerns.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Bacillus anthracis is the etiologic agent of anthrax, an acute fatal disease among mammals. It was thought to differ from Bacillus cereus, an opportunistic pathogen and cause of food poisoning, by the presence of plasmids pXO1 and pXO2, which encode the lethal toxin complex and the poly-γ-D-glutamic acid capsule, respectively. This work describes a non-B. anthracis isolate that possesses the anthrax toxin genes and is capable of causing a severe inhalation anthrax-like illness. Although initial phenotypic and 16S rRNA analysis identified this isolate as B. cereus, the rapid generation and analysis of a high-coverage draft genome sequence revealed the presence of a circular plasmid, named pBCXO1, with 99.6% similarity with the B. anthracis toxin-encoding plasmid, pXO1. Although homologues of the pXO2 encoded capsule genes were not found, a polysaccharide capsule cluster is encoded on a second, previously unidentified plasmid, pBC218. A/J mice challenged with B. cereus G9241 confirmed the virulence of this strain. These findings represent an example of how genomics could rapidly assist public health experts responding not only to clearly identified select agents but also to novel agents with similar pathogenic potentials. In this study, we combined a public health approach with genome analysis to provide insight into the correlation of phenotypic characteristics and their genetic basis.",

        "abstract": "Using mathematical models that combine population genetic and epidemiological processes, we resolve the paradox that many important pathogens appear to persist as discrete strains despite the constant exchange of genetic material. We show that dominant polymorphic determinants (that is, those that elicit the most effective immune responses) will be organized into nonoverlapping combinations as a result of selection by the host immune system, thereby defining a set of discrete independently transmitted strains. By analysing 222 isolates of Neisseria meningitidis, we show that two highly polymorphic epitopes of the outer membrane protein PorA exist in nonoverlapping combinations as predicted by this general framework. The model indicates that dominant polymorphic determinants will be in linkage disequilibrium, despite frequent genetic exchange, even though they may be encoded by several unlinked genes. This suggests that the detection of nonrandom associations between epitope regions can be employed as a novel strategem for identifying dominant polymorphic antigens.",

        "abstract": "Neisseria meningitidis is a major cause of septicaemia and meningitis worldwide. Most disease in Europe, the Americas and Australasia is caused by meningococci expressing serogroup B capsules, but no vaccine against this polysaccharide exists. Potential candidates for ‘serogroup B substitute’ vaccines are outer membrane protein antigens including the typing antigens PorA and FetA. The web-accessible PubMLST database (www.pubmlst.org) was used to investigate the temporal and geographical patterns of associations among PorA and FetA protein variants and lineages defined by combinations of housekeeping genes, known as clonal complexes. The sample contained 3460 isolates with genotypic information from 57 countries over a 74 year period. Although shifting associations among antigen variants and clonal complexes were evident, a subset of strain types associated with several serogroups persisted for decades and proliferated globally. Genetic stability among outer membrane proteins of serogroup A meningococci has been described previously, but here long-lived genetic associations were also observed among meningococci belonging to serogroups B and C. The patterns of variation were consistent with behaviour predicted by models that invoke inter-strain competition mediated by immune selection. There was also substantial geographic and temporal heterogeneity in antigenic repertoires, providing both opportunities and challenges for the design of broad coverage protein-based meningococcal vaccines.",

These species are both common commensals on the human skin and in the nasal pharynx, but are genetically distinct, differing at 24% average nucleotide divergence in 1,478 core genes. To better understand the genome dynamics of these ecologically similar staphylococcal species, we carried out a comparative analysis of 324 S. aureus and S. epidermidis genomes, including 83 novel S. epidermidis sequences. A reference pan-genome approach and whole genome multilocus-sequence typing revealed that around half of the genome was shared between the species. Based on a BratNextGen analysis, homologous recombination was found to have impacted on 40% of the core genes in S. epidermidis, but on only 24% of the core genes in S. aureus. Homologous recombination between the species is rare, with a maximum of nine gene alleles shared between any two S. epidermidis and S. aureus isolates. In contrast, there was considerable interspecies admixture of mobile elements, in particular genes associated with the SaPIn1 pathogenicity island, metal detoxification, and the methicillin-resistance island SCCmec. Our data and analysis provide a context for considering the nature of recombinational boundaries between S. aureus and S. epidermidis and, the selective forces that influence realized recombination between these species.",

The nucleotide sequence data were used to assign each isolate an allelic profile or sequence type (ST) and examine the C. jejuni population structure in terms of clonal complexes. The clonal complexes consisted of an abundant central or founder genotype (ST), after which the complex was named, together with very closely related, generally less abundant genotypes differing from the founder at one, two or three loci. The clonal complex is an informative unit for the study C. jejuni epidemiology. It provides data which enabled the choice of 13 C. jejuni founder isolates for submission to the NCTC as a representative cross‐section of the C. jejuni population. These 13 isolates provide a defined resource for further research into aspects of C. jejuni biology such as genomic diversity, virulence and adaptation to particular hosts or environmental survival.",

For many countries the implementation of effective interventions to reduce the burden of this disease is a high priority. Nucleotide sequence-based typing, including multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and antigen gene sequence typing (AGST), has provided unified, comprehensive, and portable Campylobacter isolate characterization, with curated databases of genotypes available (pubMLST.org/campylobacter). Analyses of large collections of isolates from various sources with these approaches have provided many insights into the epidemiology of these ubiquitous and diverse organisms. C. jejuni and C. coli populations are structured into clonal complexes, which reflect genealogy and are associated with specific phenotypes, e.g. the predisposition to infect particular animals, a property that has permitted the development of genetic means of attributing isolates from human disease to potential sources. This has identified retail meat, and especially chicken, as the likely cause of most human disease in many countries, although some human isolates have other likely origins. Such data have led directly to effective intervention studies and will be important in ongoing targeting of intervention strategies and the monitoring of their effectiveness. MLST and AGST data have also been employed in epidemiological investigations and studies of Campylobacter evolution and population biology. The sequence databases that have been established are compatible with the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) approaches likely to be implemented soon; indeed, the hierarchical approach adopted by MLST and AGST will be essential for the exploitation of WGS data.",

This study confirms that leprosy has a single clone origin and has spread around the globe following human migration and trade over the last several thousand years. Leprosy has affected humans for at least 4,000 years1 , with accounts of leprosy-like illnesses widespread though various cultures over many centuries. Once of global distribution, leprosy is now a curable infectious disease that nevertheless remains a major public health problem in Africa, Asia and, especially, South America. Attempts at global eradication are on-going with the WHO recently adopting a ‘final push’ strategy2. Despite its prominence and long history, many aspects of the biology of leprosy remain poorly understood, in large degree because the causative organism, the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae, remains uncultivable on artificial media. Advances have been slow and hard won3 , but in recent years the application of molecular genetics has made a major contribution to our understanding, particularly the sequencing of the complete genome of the M. leprae TN strain in 20014. This showed that the M. leprae genome was appreciably smaller than its nearest sequenced relative, M. tuberculosis (by about 1MB, or 25% of the genome), and that about half of the genome comprised inactivated pseudogenes. On pgs 1282 - 1289 of this issue, Stuart Cole and colleagues5 now report the second complete M. leprae genome sequence, that of a Brazilian strain Br4923, as well as high coverage sequencing of two additional strains and genome-wide analysis of sequence variation in a set of geographically diverse samples, including some from archaeological specimens.

A three-dimensional structural homology model for Neisseria porins was generated from Escherichia coli porin structures and N. meningitidis PorA and PorB sequences. The Neisseria sequences were readily assembled into the 16-strand β-barrel fold characteristic of porins, despite relatively low sequence identity with theEscherichia proteins. The model provided information on the spatial relationships of variable regions of peptide sequences in the PorA and PorB trimers and insights relevant to the use of these proteins in vaccines. The nucleotide sequences of the porin genes from a number of other Neisseria species were obtained by PCR direct sequencing and from GenBank. Alignment and analysis of all available Neisseria porin sequences by use of the structurally conserved regions derived from the PorA and PorB structural models resulted in the recovery of an improved phylogenetic signal. Phylogenetic analyses were consistent with an important role for horizontal genetic exchange in the emergence of different porin classes and confirmed the close evolutionary relationships of the porins from N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae,Neisseria lactamica, and Neisseria polysaccharea. Only members of this group contained three conserved lysine residues which form a potential GTP binding site implicated in pathogenesis. The model placed these residues on the inside of the pore, in close proximity, consistent with their role in regulating pore function when inserted into host cells.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Highly parallel, ‘second generation’ sequencing technologies have rapidly expanded the number of bacterial whole genome sequences available for study, permitting the emergence of the discipline of population genomics. Most of these data are publically available as unassembled short-read sequence files that require extensive processing before they can be used for analysis. The provision of data in a uniform format, which can be easily assessed for quality, linked to provenance and phenotype and used for analysis, is therefore necessary. The performance of de novo short-read assembly followed by automatic annotation using the pubMLST.org Neisseria database was assessed and evaluated for 108 diverse, representative, and well-characterised Neisseria meningitidis isolates. High-quality sequences were obtained for >99% of known meningococcal genes among the de novo assembled genomes and four resequenced genomes and less than 1% of reassembled genes had sequence discrepancies or misassembled sequences. A core genome of 1600 loci, present in at least 95% of the population, was determined using the Genome Comparator tool. Genealogical relationships compatible with, but at a higher resolution than, those identified by multilocus sequence typing were obtained with core genome comparisons and ribosomal protein gene analysis which revealed a genomic structure for a number of previously described phenotypes. This unified system for cataloguing Neisseria genetic variation in the genome was implemented and used for multiple analyses and the data are publically available in the PubMLST Neisseria database. The de novo assembly, combined with automated gene-by-gene annotation, generates high quality draft genomes in which the majority of protein-encoding genes are present with high accuracy. The approach catalogues diversity efficiently, permits analyses of a single genome or multiple genome comparisons, and is a practical approach to interpreting WGS data for large bacterial population samples. The method generates novel insights into the biology of the meningococcus and improves our understanding of the whole population structure, not just disease causing lineages.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Periodically, new disease-associated variants of the human pathogenNeisseria meningitidis arise. These meningococci diversify during spread, and related isolates recovered from different parts of the world have different genetic and antigenic characteristics. An example is the ET-5 complex, members of which were isolated globally from the mid-1970s onwards. Isolates from a hyperendemic outbreak of meningococcal disease in Worcester, England, during the late 1980s were characterized by multilocus sequence typing and sequence determination of antigen genes. These data established that the Worcester outbreak was caused by ET-5 complex meningococci which were not closely related to the ET-5 complex bacteria responsible for a hyperendemic outbreak in the nearby town of Stroud during the years preceding the Worcester outbreak. A comparison with other ET-5 complex meningococci established that there were at least three distinct globally distributed subpopulations within the ET-5 complex, characterized by particular housekeeping and antigen gene alleles. The Worcester isolates belonged to one of these subpopulations, the Stroud isolates belonged to another, and at least one representative of the third subpopulation identified in this work was isolated elsewhere in the United Kingdom. The sequence data demonstrated that ET-5 variants have arisen by multiple complex pathways involving the recombination of antigen and housekeeping genes and de novo mutation of antigen genes. The data further suggest that either the ET-5 complex has been in existence for many years, evolving and spreading relatively slowly until its disease-causing potential was recognized, or it has evolved and spread rapidly since its first identification in the 1970s, with each of the subpopulations attaining a distribution spanning several continents.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Serogroup A Neisseria meningitidis (NmA) was the cause of the 2011 meningitis epidemics in Chad. This bacterium, often carried asymptomatically, is considered to be an “accidental pathogen”; however, the transition from carriage to disease phenotype remains poorly understood. This study examined the role genetic diversity might play in this transition by comparing genomes from geographically and temporally matched invasive and carried NmA isolates. All 23 NmA isolates belonged to the ST-5 clonal complex (cc5). Ribosomal MLST comparison with other publically available NmA:cc5 showed that isolates were closely related, although those from Chad formed two distinct branches and did not cluster with other NmA, based on their MLST profile, geographical and temporal location. Whole genome MLST (wgMLST) comparison identified 242 variable genes among all Chadian isolates and clustered them into three distinct phylogenetic groups (Clusters 1, 2, and 3): no systematic clustering by disease or carriage source was observed. There was a significant difference (p = 0.0070) between the mean age of the individuals from which isolates from Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 were obtained, irrespective of whether the person was a case or a carrier. Whole genome sequencing provided high-resolution characterization of the genetic diversity of these closely related NmA isolates. The invasive meningococcal isolates obtained during the epidemic were not homogeneous; rather, a variety of closely related but distinct clones were circulating in the human population with some clones preferentially colonizing specific age groups, reflecting a potential age-related niche adaptation. Systematic genetic differences were not identified between carriage and disease isolates consistent with invasive meningococcal disease being a multi-factorial event resulting from changes in host-pathogen interactions along with the bacterium.",

        "abstract": "Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) is a major surface component of the cell walls of Neisseria meningitidis, which is important for its roles in pathogenesis and antigenic variation, as a target for immunological typing, and as a possible vaccine component. Although the structures of many antigenic variants have been determined, routine immunological typing of these molecules remains problematic. Resonant mirror analysis was combined with gene sequencing to characterize two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) used in typing panels that were raised against the same LOS immunotype, L3,7,9. The two MAbs (MAb 4A8-B2 and MAb 9-2-L379) were of the same immunoglobulin subtype, but while MAb 9-2-L379 was more than a 1,000-fold more sensitive in immunotyping assays of both whole meningococcal cells and purified LOS, MAb 4A8-B2 was more specific for immunotype L3,7,9. The differences in sensitivity were a consequence of MAb 9-2-L379 having a 44-fold-faster association constant than MAb 4A8-B2. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the variable chains of the MAbs revealed that they had very similar heavy chains (81% amino acid sequence identity) but diverse light chains (54% sequence identity). The differential binding kinetics and specificities observed with these MAbs were probably due to differences in the epitopes recognized, and these were probably a consequence of the different immunization protocols used in their production.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "New vaccines targeting meningococci expressing serogroup B polysaccharide have been developed, with some being licensed in Europe. Coverage depends on the distribution of disease-associated genotypes, which may vary by age. It is well established that a small number of hyperinvasive lineages account for most disease, and these lineages are associated with particular antigens, including vaccine candidates. A collection of 4,048 representative meningococcal disease isolates from 18 European countries, collected over a 3-year period, were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Age data were available for 3,147 isolates. The proportions of hyperinvasive lineages, identified as particular clonal complexes (ccs) by MLST, differed among age groups. Subjects <1 year of age experienced lower risk of sequence type 11 (ST-11) cc, ST-32 cc, and ST-269 cc disease and higher risk of disease due to unassigned STs, 1- to 4-year-olds experienced lower risk of ST-11 cc and ST-32 cc disease, 5- to 14-year-olds were less likely to experience ST-11 cc and ST-269 cc disease, and ≥25-year-olds were more likely to experience disease due to less common ccs and unassigned STs. Younger and older subjects were vulnerable to a more diverse set of genotypes, indicating the more clonal nature of genotypes affecting adolescents and young adults. Knowledge of temporal and spatial diversity and the dynamics of meningococcal populations is essential for disease control by vaccines, as coverage is lineage specific. The nonrandom age distribution of hyperinvasive lineages has consequences for the design and implementation of vaccines, as different variants, or perhaps targets, may be required for different age groups.",

        "abstract": "The increase in the capacity and reduction in cost of whole-genome sequencing methods present the imminent prospect of such data being used routinely in real time for investigations of bacterial disease outbreaks. For this to be realized, however, it is necessary that generic, portable, and robust analysis frameworks be available, which can be readily interpreted and used in real time by microbiologists, clinicians, and public health epidemiologists. We have achieved this with a set of analysis tools integrated into the PubMLST.org website, which can in principle be used for the analysis of any pathogen. The approach is demonstrated with genomic data from isolates obtained during a well-characterized meningococcal disease outbreak at the University of Southampton, United Kingdom, that occurred in 1997. Whole-genome sequence data were collected, de novo assembled, and deposited into the PubMLST Neisseria BIGSdb database, which automatically annotated the sequences. This enabled the immediate and backwards-compatible classification of the isolates with a number of schemes, including the following: conventional, extended, and ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (MLST, eMLST, and rMLST); antigen gene sequence typing (AGST); analysis based on genes conferring antibiotic susceptibility. The isolates were also compared to a reference isolate belonging to the same clonal complex (ST-11) at 1,975 loci. Visualization of the data with the NeighborNet algorithm, implemented in SplitsTree 4 within the PubMLST website, permitted complete resolution of the outbreak and related isolates, demonstrating that multiple closely related but distinct strains were simultaneously present in asymptomatic carriage and disease, with two causing disease and one responsible for the outbreak itself.",

        "abstract": "Previous estimates of rates of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitution among Neisseria meningitidis gene sequences suggested that the surface loops of the variable outer membrane protein PorB were under only weak selection pressure from the host immune response. These findings were consistent with studies indicating that PorB variants were not always protective in immunological and microbiological assays and questioned the suitability of this protein as a vaccine component. PorB, which is expressed at high levels on the surface of the meningococcus, has been implicated in mechanisms of pathogenesis and has also been used as a typing target in epidemiological investigations. In this work, using more precise estimates of selection pressures and recombination rates, we have shown that some residues in the surface loops of PorB are under very strong positive selection, as great as that observed in human immunodeficiency virus-1 surface glycoproteins, whereas amino acids within the loops and the membrane-spanning regions of the protein are under purifying selection, presumably because of structural constraints. Congruence tests showed that recombination occurred at a rate that was not sufficient to erase all phylogenetic similarity and did not greatly bias selection analysis. Homology models of PorB structure indicated that many strongly selected sites encoded residues that were predicted to be exposed to host immune responses, implying that this protein is under strong immune selection and requires further examination as a potential vaccine candidate. These data show that phylogenetic inference can be used to complement immunological and biochemical data in the choice of vaccine candidates.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Herd protection by meningococcal vaccines is conferred by population-level reduction of meningococcal nasopharyngeal colonization. Given the inverse epidemiological association between colonization by commensal Neisseria lactamica and meningococcal disease, we investigated whether controlled infection of human volunteers with N. lactamica prevents colonization by Neisseria meningitidis. In a block-randomized human challenge study, 310 university students were inoculated with 104 colony-forming units of N. lactamica or were sham-inoculated, and carriage was monitored for 26 weeks, after which all participants were reinoculated with N. lactamica and resampled 2 weeks later. At baseline, natural N. meningitidis carriage in the control group was 22.4% (36/161), which increased to 33.6% (48/143) by week 26. Two weeks after inoculation of N. lactamica, 33.6% (48/143) of the challenge group became colonized with N. lactamica. In this group, meningococcal carriage reduced from 24.2% (36/149) at inoculation to 14.7% (21/143) 2 weeks after inoculation (−9.5%; P = .006). The inhibition of meningococcal carriage was only observed in carriers of N. lactamica, was due both to displacement of existing meningococci and to inhibition of new acquisition, and persisted over at least 16 weeks. Crossover inoculation of controls with N. lactamica replicated the result. Genome sequencing showed that inhibition affected multiple meningococcal sequence types. The inhibition of meningococcal carriage by N. lactamica is even more potent than after glycoconjugate meningococcal vaccination. Neisseria lactamica or its components could be a novel bacterial medicine to suppress meningococcal outbreaks. This observation explains the epidemiological observation of natural immunity conferred by carriage of N. lactamica.",

        "abstract": "The development and implementation of conjugate polysaccharide vaccines against invasive bacterial diseases, specifically those caused by the encapsulated bacteria Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae, has been one of the most effective public health innovations of the last 25 years. These vaccines have resulted in significant reductions in childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide, with their effectiveness due in large part to their ability to induce long-lasting immunity in a range of age groups. At the population level this immunity reduces carriage and interrupts transmission resulting in herd immunity; however, these beneficial effects can be counterbalanced by the selection pressures that immunity against carriage can impose, potentially promoting the emergence and spread of virulent vaccine escape variants. Studies following the implementation of meningococcal serogroup C vaccines improved our understanding of these effects in relation to the biology of accidental pathogens such as the meningococcus. This understanding has enabled the refinement of the implementation of conjugate polysaccharide vaccines against meningitis-associated bacteria, and will be crucial in maintaining and improving vaccine control of these infections. To date there is little evidence for the spread of virulent vaccine escape variants of the meningococcus and H. influenzae, although this has been reported in pneumococci.",

        "abstract": "The comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences is widely used to differentiate bacteria; however, this gene can lack resolution among closely related but distinct members of the same genus. This is a problem in clinical situations in those genera, such as Neisseria, where some species are associated with disease while others are not. Here, we identified and validated an alternative genetic target common to all Neisseria species which can be readily sequenced to provide an assay that rapidly and accurately discriminates among members of the genus. Ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST) using ribosomal protein genes has been shown to unambiguously identify these bacteria. The PubMLST Neisseria database (http://pubmlst.org/neisseria/) was queried to extract the 53 ribosomal protein gene sequences from 44 genomes from diverse species. Phylogenies reconstructed from these genes were examined, and a single 413-bp fragment of the 50S ribosomal protein L6 (rplF) gene was identified which produced a phylogeny that was congruent with the phylogeny reconstructed from concatenated ribosomal protein genes. Primers that enabled the amplification and direct sequencing of the rplF gene fragment were designed to validate the assay in vitro and in silico. Allele sequences were defined for the gene fragment, associated with particular species names, and stored on the PubMLST Neisseria database, providing a curated electronic resource. This approach provides an alternative to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, which can be readily replicated for other organisms for which more resolution is required, and it has potential applications in high-resolution metagenomic studies.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Various typing methods have been developed for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but none provide the combination of discrimination, reproducibility, portability, and genetic inference that allows the analysis of all aspects of the epidemiology of this pathogen from a single data set. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) has been used successfully to characterize the related organisms Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria lactamica. Here, the same seven locus Neisseria scheme was used to characterize a diverse collection of N. gonorrhoeae isolates to investigate whether this method would allow differentiation among isolates, and to distinguish these three species. A total of 149 gonococcal isolates were typed and submitted to the Neisseria MLST database. Although relatively few (27) polymorphisms were detected among the seven MLST loci, a total of 66 unique allele combinations (sequence types, STs), were observed, a number comparable to that seen among isolate collections of the more diverse meningococcus. Patterns of genetic variation were consistent with high levels of recombination generating this diversity. There was no evidence for geographical structuring among the isolates examined, with isolates collected in Liverpool, UK, showing levels of diversity similar to a global collection of isolates. There was, however, evidence that populations of N. meningitidis, N. gonorrhoeae and N. lactamica were distinct, with little support for frequent genetic recombination among these species, with the sequences from the gdh locus alone grouping the species into distinct clusters. The seven loci Neisseria MLST scheme was readily adapted to N. gonorrhoeae isolates, providing a highly discriminatory typing method. In addition, these data permitted phylogenetic and population genetic inferences to be made, including direct comparisons with N. meningitidis and N. lactamica. Examination of these data demonstrated that alleles were rarely shared among the three species. Analysis of variation at a single locus, gdh, provided a rapid means of identifying misclassified isolates and determining whether mixed cultures were present.",

        "abstract": "Characterization of isolates of Neisseria meningitidisobtained from patients with meningococcal disease or from pharyngeal swabs of asymptomatic carriers can be achieved by several approaches which provide different levels of discrimination. A total of 45 gram negative, oxidase-positive diplococcus strains isolated from 15 individuals with meningococcal disease and 30 of their family contacts were examined by three approaches: serological typing, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE), and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). For 10 of the 15 patient and contact groups, all of the isolates were confirmed as meningococci, and the bacteria obtained from the patients and contacts, including their mother or principal caregiver in the case of children, were indistinguishable by all three methods. In the remaining five groups the isolates from the patients were distinct from those recovered from the contacts, and in three examples, in two separate groups, the contacts were shown by MLST to be carrying strains of Neisseria lactamica. The data obtained from the three techniques were consistent, although complete serological typing was possible for only a minority of isolates. Both MLEE and MLST established the genetic relationships of the isolates and identified members of known hypervirulent lineages, but MLST was faster than MLEE and had the additional advantages that it could be performed on noninfective material distributed by mail and that the results from different laboratories could be compared via the internet ",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Neisseria lactamica, a harmless human commensal found predominantly in the upper respiratory tracts of infants, is closely related to Neisseria meningitidis, a pathogen of global significance. Colonization with N. lactamica may be responsible for the increase in immunity to meningococcal disease that occurs during childhood, when rates of meningococcal carriage are low. This observation has led to the suggestion that N. lactamica whole cells or components are potential constituents of novel meningococcal vaccines. However, the dynamics of carriage and population diversity of N. lactamica in children are poorly understood, presenting difficulties for the choice of representative isolates for use in vaccine development. This problem was addressed by the multilocus sequence typing of N. lactamica isolates from two longitudinal studies of bacterial carriage in infants. The studies comprised 100 and 216 subjects, with N. lactamica carriage monitored from age 4 weeks until age 96 weeks and from age 2 weeks until age 24 weeks, respectively. The maximum observed carriage rate was 44% at 56 weeks of age, with isolates obtained on multiple visits for the majority (54 of 75, 72%) of carriers. The N. lactamica isolates were genetically diverse, with 69 distinct genotypes recovered from the 75 infants. Carriage was generally long-lived, with an average rate of loss of under 1% per week during the 28 weeks following acquisition. Only 11 of the 75 infants carried more than one genotypically unique isolate during the course of the study. Some participants shared identical isolates with siblings, but none shared identical isolates with their parents. These findings have implications for the design of vaccines based on this organism.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Unlike those of animals and plants, sexual processes in bacteria are not linked to reproduction per se and are a consequence of horizontal (sometimes called lateral) gene transfer (HGT). This is the acquisition of genetic material from a nonparental source and its incorporation into the genome, usually by recombination. The relative and absolute rates of HGT in different bacteria vary greatly, and this has a major influence on population diversity, structure and evolution. Rates of HGT are influenced by both mechanistic and ecological considerations, and when HGT is absent or very rare, bacterial populations become completely clonal. In such populations, evolution occurs solely by the accumulation of mutations, accompanied by diversity reduction events such as periodic selection and/or stochastic bottlenecks, which can result in hitchhiking events that fix mutations, whether beneficial, deleterious or neutral in their effect on fitness. The net effect is the establishment of distinct lineages within the population, which are characterized by low genetic diversity accompanied by the relaxation of purifying selection and an enhancement of the effects of genetic drift. The best examples of such bacteria are well-known obligate pathogens that affect humans, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Yersinia pestis, Bacillus anthracis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi and Bordetella pertussis. Each of these pathogens has evolved from a more diverse parental population as a result of a shift in niche from a free-living organism to an obligate parasite. In some cases, this was caused or accompanied by a HGT event, but ultimately the process has led to reproductive isolation: the inhibition of further HGT with the parental population, the wider bacterial community, and even among members of the population itself. While this reproductive isolation may have promoted specialization and eventually speciation, it can also result in loss of fitness, as a consequence of the accumulation of deleterious or mildly deleterious mutations, a process known as Muller’s ratchet. Since their emergence, the evolution of these organisms has been further influenced by ecological factors resulting from changes in human behaviour, including increased population numbers and density and the use of antibiotics.",

        "abstract": "Dichelobacter nodosus (D. nodosus) is the causative pathogen of ovine footrot, a disease that has a significant welfare and financial impact on the global sheep industry. Previous studies into the phylogenetics of D. nodosus have focused on Australia and Scandinavia, meaning the current diversity in the United Kingdom (U.K.) population and its relationship globally, is poorly understood. Numerous epidemiological methods are available for bacterial typing; however, few account for whole genome diversity or provide the opportunity for future application of new computational techniques. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) measures nucleotide variations within several loci with slow accumulation of variation to enable the designation of allele numbers to determine a sequence type. The usage of whole genome sequence data enables the application of MLST, but also core and whole genome MLST for higher levels of strain discrimination with a negligible increase in experimental cost. An MLST database was developed alongside a seven loci scheme using publically available whole genome data from the sequence read archive. Sequence type designation and strain discrimination was compared to previously published data to ensure reproducibility. Multiple D. nodosus isolates from U.K. farms were directly compared to populations from other countries. The U.K. isolates define new clades within the global population of D. nodosus and predominantly consist of serogroups A, B and H, however serogroups C, D, E, and I were also found.",

The data obtained showed that five distinctNeisseria meningitidis strains belonging to the ET-37 complex were present in the student population during the outbreak. Three of these strains were not associated with invasive disease, and two distinct strains caused invasive disease, including several fatalities. The initial case of the disease cluster was caused by a strain distinct from that responsible for at least two subsequent cases and two cases remote from the university, which were epidemiologically linked to the outbreak. These observations were consistent with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis data, but the sequence data alone were sufficient to resolve the strains involved in the disease cluster. Interpretation of the nucleotide sequence data was more straightforward than interpretation of the fingerprint patterns, and the sequence data provided information on the genetic differences among the isolates.",

Although generally self limiting, this disease has an important economic impact (Skirrow and Blaser, 1992). More serious complications, such as motor neurone paralysis, arise in 1–2 cases per 100,000 people in the UK and USA (Nachamkin et al., 1998).

        "abstract": "Improved understanding of the epidemiology of Streptococcus equi transmission requires sensitive and portable subtyping methods that can rationally discriminate between strains. S. equi is highly homogeneous and cannot be distinguished by multilocus enzyme electrophoretic or multilocus sequence-typing methods that utilize housekeeping genes. However, on sequence analysis of the N-terminal region of the SeM genes of 60 S. equi isolates from 27 strangles outbreaks, we identified 21 DNA codon changes. These resulted in the nonsynonymous substitution of 18 amino acids and allowed the assignment of S. equi strains to 15 distinct subtypes. Our data suggest the presence of multiple epitopes across this region that are subjected to selective immune pressure (nonsynonymous-synonymous substitution rate [dN/dS] ratio = 3.054), particularly during the establishment of long-term S. equi infection. We further report the application of SeM gene subtyping as a method to investigate potential cases of disease related to administration of a live attenuated S. equi vaccine. SeM gene subtyping successfully differentiated between the vaccine strain and field strains of S. equi responsible for concurrent disease. These results were confirmed by the development and application of a PCR diagnostic test, which identifies the aroA partial gene deletion present in the Equilis StrepE vaccine strain. Although the vaccine strain was found to be responsible for injection site lesions, all seven outbreaks of strangles investigated in recently vaccinated horses were found to be due to concurrent infection with wild-type S. equi and not due to reversion of the vaccine strain.",

        "abstract": "The increasing availability of hundreds of whole bacterial genomes provides opportunities for enhanced understanding of the genes and alleles responsible for clinically important phenotypes and how they evolved. However, it is a significant challenge to develop easy-to-use and scalable methods for characterizing these large and complex data and relating it to disease epidemiology. Existing approaches typically focus on either homologous sequence variation in genes that are shared by all isolates, or non-homologous sequence variation - focusing on genes that are differentially present in the population. Here we present a comparative genomics approach that simultaneously approximates core and accessory genome variation in pathogen populations and apply it to pathogenic species in the genus Campylobacter. A total of 7 published Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli genomes were selected to represent diversity across these species, and a list of all loci that were present at least once was compiled. After filtering duplicates a 7-isolate reference pan-genome, of 3,933 loci, was defined. A core genome of 1,035 genes was ubiquitous in the sample accounting for 59% of the genes in each isolate (average genome size of 1.68 Mb). The accessory genome contained 2,792 genes. A Campylobacter population sample of 192 genomes was screened for the presence of reference pan-genome loci with gene presence defined as a BLAST match of ≥70% identity over ≥50% of the locus length - aligned using MUSCLE on a gene-by-gene basis. A total of 21 genes were present only in C. coli and 27 only in C. jejuni, providing information about functional differences associated with species and novel epidemiological markers for population genomic analyses. Homologs of these genes were found in several of the genomes used to define the pan-genome and, therefore, would not have been identified using a single reference strain approach.",

        "abstract": "Following the introduction of effective protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines against capsular group C meningococcal disease in Europe, meningococci of capsular group B remain a major cause of death and can result in debilitating sequelae. The outer membrane proteins PorA and FetA have previously been shown to induce bactericidal antibodies in humans. Despite considerable antigenic variation among PorA and FetA OMPs in meningococci, systematic molecular epidemiological studies revealed this variation is highly structured so that a limited repertoire of antigenic types is congruent with the hyperinvasive meningococcal lineages that have caused most of the meningococcal disease in Europe in recent decades. Here we describe the development of a prototype vaccine against capsular group B meningococcal infection based on a N. meningitidis isolate genetically engineered to have constitutive expression of the outer membrane protein FetA. Deoxycholate outer membrane vesicles (dOMVs) extracted from cells cultivated in modified Frantz medium contained 21.8% PorA protein, 7.7% FetA protein and 0.03 μg LPS per μg protein (3%). The antibody response to the vaccine was tested in three mouse strains and the toxicological profile of the vaccine was tested in New Zealand white rabbits. Administration of the vaccine, MenPF-1, when given by intramuscular injection on 4 occasions over a 9 week period, was well tolerated in rabbits up to 50 μg/dose, with no evidence of systemic toxicity. These data indicated that the MenPF-1 vaccine had a toxicological profile suitable for testing in a phase I clinical trial.",

Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was employed to investigate the association between Opa repertoires and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) genotypes. Associations with clinical severity were also analyzed statistically. High levels of diversity were observed in opa alleles, variable regions, and repertoires, and MDS revealed that MLST genotypes were strongly associated with particular Opa repertoires. Individual Opa proteins or repertoires were not associated with clinical severity, though there was a trend toward an association with the opaD locus. Meningococcal Opa repertoire is strongly linked to MLST genotype irrespective of epidemiological sampling and therefore correlates with invasiveness. It is not, however, strongly associated with severity of meningococcal disease.",

        "abstract": "In common with other bacterial taxa, members of the genus Neisseria are classified using a range of phenotypic and biochemical approaches, which are not entirely satisfactory in assigning isolates to species groups. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using nucleotide sequences for bacterial typing and taxonomy, but to date, no broadly accepted alternative to conventional methods is available. Here, the taxonomic relationships of 55 representative members of the genus Neisseria have been analysed using whole-genome sequence data. As genetic material belonging to the accessory genome is widely shared among different taxa but not present in all isolates, this analysis indexed nucleotide sequence variation within sets of genes, specifically protein-coding genes that were present and directly comparable in all isolates. Variation in these genes identified seven species groups, which were robust to the choice of genes and phylogenetic clustering methods used. The groupings were largely, but not completely, congruent with current species designations, with some minor changes in nomenclature and the reassignment of a few isolates necessary. In particular, these data showed that isolates classified as Neisseria polysaccharea are polyphyletic and probably include more than one taxonomically distinct organism. The seven groups could be reliably and rapidly generated with sequence variation within the 53 ribosomal protein subunit (rps) genes, further demonstrating that ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST) is a practicable and powerful means of characterizing bacteria at all levels, from domain to strain.",

Most chronic infections (24 of 33) were due to continuous infection of the mammary quarter with the same sequence type, and infections were found to persist for many months. The remaining quarters were re-infected with a different sequence type within a single lactation. No particular sequence type or clonal complex (lineage) was associated with persisting infections, indicating that the outcome of intramammary infections with S. uberis is more likely to be dependent on host factors than on inter-strain differences.

        "abstract": "Neisseria meningitidis causes half a million cases of septicemia and meningitis globally each year. The opacity (Opa) integral outer membrane proteins from N. meningitidis are polymorphic and highly immunogenic. Particular combinations of Opa proteins are associated with the hyperinvasive meningococcal lineages that have caused the majority of serogroup B and C meningococcal disease in industrialized countries over the last 60 years. For the first time, this genetic structuring of a diverse outer membrane protein family has been used to select a novel combination of representative antigens for immunogenicity testing. Fourteen recombinant Opa variants were produced and used in murine immunizations inducing an increase in specific antimeningococcal total IgG levels. All 14 Opa proteins elicited bactericidal antibodies against at least one hyperinvasive meningococcal isolate, and most isolates from each hyperinvasive lineage were killed by at least one Opa antiserum at a titer of 1:16 or greater. Cross-reactive bactericidal antibody responses were observed among clonal complexes. A theoretical coverage of 90% can be achieved by using a particular combination of 6 Opa proteins against an isolate collection of 227 recent United Kingdom disease cases. This study indicates the potential of Opa proteins to provide broad coverage against multiple meningococcal hyperinvasive lineages.",

Genetic analyses of meningococcal populations have provided many insights into the biology, evolution and pathogenesis of this important pathogen. The meningococcus, and its close relative the gonococcus, are the only pathogenic members of the genus Neisseria, and the invasive propensity of meningococci varies widely, with approximately a dozen ‘hyperinvasive lineages’ responsible for most disease. Despite this, attempts to identify a ‘pathogenome’, a subset of genes associated with the invasive phenotypes, have failed; however, genome-wide studies of representative meningococcal isolates using high-throughput sequencing are beginning to provide details on the relationship of invasive phenotype and genotype in this fascinating organism and how this relationship has evolved.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "No comprehensive antimeningococcal vaccine is available, largely as a consequence of the high sequence diversity of those surface proteins that could function as components of a vaccine. One such component is the protein PorA, a major surface porin of this Gram‐negative organism that has been used in a number of experimental and licensed vaccines. Here we describe a series of experiments designed to investigate the consequences for antibody recognition of sequence diversity within a PorA antigen. The binding of a 14‐residue peptide, corresponding to the P1.2 subtype antigen, to the MN16C13F4 monoclonal antibody was sensitive to mutation of five out of the six residues within the epitope sequence. The crystal structure of the antibody Fab fragment, determined in complex with the peptide antigen, shows a remarkably hydrophobic binding site and interactions between the antigen and antibody are dominated by apolar residues. Nine intrachain hydrogen bonds are formed within the antigen which maintain the β‐hairpin conformation of the peptide. These hydrogen bonds involve residues that are highly conserved amongst different P1.2 sequence variants, suggesting that some positions may be conserved for structural reasons in these highly polymorphic regions. The sensitivity of antibody recognition of the antigen towards mutation provides a structural explanation for the widespread sequence variation seen in different PorA sequences in this region. Single point mutations are sufficient to remove binding capability, providing a rationale for the manner in which different meningococcal PorA escape variants arise.",

Molecular approaches, specifically DNA amplification and sequencing, are the methods of choice for various reasons, including: their generic nature and portability, comprehensive coverage, and ready implementation to culture negative clinical specimens. The following target genes are recommended: (1) the variable regions of the antigen-encoding genes porA and fetA and, if additional resolution is required, the porB gene for rapid investigation of disease outbreaks and investigating the distribution of antigenic variants; (2) the seven multilocus sequence typing loci–these data are essential for the most effective national, and international management of meningococcal disease, as well as being invaluable in studies of meningococcal population biology and evolution. These targets have been employed extensively in reference laboratories throughout the world and validated protocols have been published.

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Bacteria exploit an arsenal of antimicrobial peptides and proteins to compete with each other. Three main competition systems have been described: type six secretion systems (T6SS); contact dependent inhibition (CDI); and bacteriocins. Unlike T6SS and CDI systems, bacteriocins do not require contact between bacteria but are diffusible toxins released into the environment. Identified almost a century ago, our understanding of bacteriocin distribution and prevalence in bacterial populations remains poor. In the case of protein bacteriocins, this is because of high levels of sequence diversity and difficulties in distinguishing their killing domains from those of other competition systems. Here, we develop a robust bioinformatics pipeline exploiting Hidden Markov Models for the identification of nuclease bacteriocins (NBs) in bacteria of which, to-date, only a handful are known. NBs are large (>60 kDa) toxins that target nucleic acids (DNA, tRNA or rRNA) in the cytoplasm of susceptible bacteria, usually closely related to the producing organism. We identified >3000 NB genes located on plasmids or on the chromosome from 53 bacterial species distributed across different ecological niches, including human, animals, plants, and the environment. A newly identified NB predicted to be specific for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (pyocin Sn) was produced and shown to kill P. aeruginosa thereby validating our pipeline. Intriguingly, while the genes encoding the machinery needed for NB translocation across the cell envelope are widespread in Gram-negative bacteria, NBs are found exclusively in γ-proteobacteria. Similarity network analysis demonstrated that NBs fall into eight groups each with a distinct arrangement of protein domains involved in import. The only structural feature conserved across all groups was a sequence motif critical for cell-killing that is generally not found in bacteriocins targeting the periplasm, implying a specific role in translocating the nuclease to the cytoplasm. Finally, we demonstrate a significant association between nuclease colicins, NBs specific for Escherichia coli, and virulence factors, suggesting NBs play a role in infection processes, most likely by enabling pathogens to outcompete commensal bacteria.",

        "abstract": "Recombination enhances the adaptive potential of organisms by allowing genetic variants to be tested on multiple genomic backgrounds. Its distribution in the genome can provide insight into the evolutionary forces that underlie traits, such as the emergence of pathogenicity. Here, we examined landscapes of realized homologous recombination of 500 genomes from ten bacterial species and found all species have “hot” regions with elevated rates relative to the genome average. We examined the size, gene content, and chromosomal features associated with these regions and the correlations between closely related species. The recombination landscape is variable and evolves rapidly. For example in Salmonella, only short regions of around 1 kb in length are hot whereas in the closely related species Escherichia coli, some hot regions exceed 100 kb, spanning many genes. Only Streptococcus pyogenes shows evidence for the positive correlation between GC content and recombination that has been reported for several eukaryotes. Genes with function related to the cell surface/membrane are often found in recombination hot regions but E. coli is the only species where genes annotated as “virulence associated” are consistently hotter. There is also evidence that some genes with “housekeeping” functions tend to be overrepresented in cold regions. For example, ribosomal proteins showed low recombination in all of the species. Among specific genes, transferrin-binding proteins are recombination hot in all three of the species in which they were found, and are subject to interspecies recombination.",

The antigenically variable loops are encoded by variable regions 1 and 2 (VR1 and VR2) of the porA gene, respectively. Although this variation was first recognized by the use of murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (1), it is more reliably deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the porAgene, considering the deficiencies inherent in the serological approach: the panel of MAb subtyping reagents is not comprehensive (4, 7, 9); it is becoming increasingly obsolete, as the antigenic composition of PorA continually evolves under the immune selection imposed by the host (6); murine MAbs have limited relevance to vaccine design, when epitopes recognized in the human immune response are required (3, 9); and the early use of antibiotic therapy in meningococcal disease has increased the dependence on PCR-based diagnoses and subtyping (",

A biovar of S. zooepidemicus, Streptococcus equi subsp. equi, is the causative agent of strangles, one of the most important infections of horses worldwide. We report here the development of the first multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for S. zooepidemicus and its exploitation to define the population genetic structure of these related pathogens. A total of 130 unique sequence types were identified from 277 isolates of diverse geographical and temporal origin. Isolates of S. equi shared a recent evolutionary ancestor with isolates of S. zooepidemicus that were significantly associated with cases of uterine infection or abortion in horses (P<0.001). Isolates of S. zooepidemicus from three UK outbreaks of acute fatal haemorrhagic pneumonia in dogs during 1999, 2001 and 2008 were found to be related to isolates from three outbreaks of this disease in the USA during 2005, 1993 and 2006, respectively. Our data provide strong evidence that S. equi evolved from an ancestral S. zooepidemicus strain and that certain related strains of S. zooepidemicus have a greater propensity to infect particular hosts and tissues.",

        "abstract": "The lack of an anti-capsular vaccine against serogroup B meningococcal disease has necessitated the exploration of alternative vaccine candidates, mostly proteins exhibiting varying degrees of antigenic variation. Analysis of variants of antigen-encoding genes is facilitated by publicly accessible online sequence repositories, such as the Neisseria PubMLST database and the associated Meningitis Research Foundation Meningococcus Genome Library (MRF-MGL). We investigated six proposed meningococcal vaccine formulations by deducing the prevalence of their components in the isolates represented in these repositories. Despite high diversity, a limited number of antigenic variants of each of the vaccine antigens were prevalent, with strong associations of particular variant combinations with given serogroups and genotypes. In the MRF-MGL and globally, the highest levels of identical sequences were observed with multicomponent/multivariant vaccines. Our analyses further demonstrated that certain combinations of antigen variants were prevalent over periods of decades in widely differing locations, indicating that vaccine formulations containing a judicious choice of antigen variants have potential for long-term protection across geographic regions. The data further indicated that formulations with multiple variants would be especially relevant at times of low disease incidence, as relative diversity was higher. Continued surveillance is required to monitor the changing prevalence of these vaccine antigens.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "The common zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter coli is an important cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide but its evolution is incompletely understood. Using multilocus sequence type (MLST) data of 7 housekeeping genes from a national survey of Campylobacter in Scotland (2005/6), and a combined population genetic-phylogenetics approach, we investigated the evolutionary history of C. coli. Genealogical reconstruction of isolates from clinical infection, farm animals and the environment, revealed a three-clade genetic structure. The majority of farm animal, and all disease causing genotypes belonged to a single clade (clade 1) which had comparatively low synonymous sequence diversity, little deep branching genetic structure, and a higher number of shared alleles providing evidence of recent clonal decent. Calibration of the rate of molecular evolution, based on within-species genetic variation, estimated a more rapid rate of evolution than in traditional estimates. This placed the divergence of the clades at less than 2500 years ago, consistent with the introduction of an agricultural niche having had an effect upon the evolution of the C. coli clades. Attribution of clinical isolate genotypes to source, using an asymmetric island model, confirmed that strains from chicken and ruminants, and not pigs or turkeys, are the principal source of human C. coli infection. Taken together these analyses are consistent with an evolutionary scenario describing the emergence of agriculture-associated C. coli lineage that is an important human pathogen.",

        "abstract": "Chicken meat represents an important source of Campylobacter infections of humans world-wide. A better understanding of Campylobacter epidemiology in commercial chicken flocks will facilitate the development of more effective intervention strategies. We developed a gene-specific parallel sequencing approach that efficiently indicated genetic diversity in farm-derived samples and revealed Campylobacter genotypes that would not be detected using microbiological culture. Parallel sequencing of the porA nucleotide fragment identified a different pattern of diversity in broiler flocks compared with broiler-breeder flocks at both individual bird and flock levels. Amongst the flocks tested, broiler flocks and individual birds were dominated by one or two porA fragment types whereas co-dominance with up to six porA fragment types was evident in breeder birds. A high proportion (83.6–93.3%) of porA variants were shared between broiler and breeder flocks. The porA-based diversity profiling could be a useful addition to the repertoire of tools employed to attribute potential sources of contamination for broiler flocks, including the environment, wild animals or other chickens. This approach can be extended to include other loci within Campylobacter and developed for molecular epidemiology studies of other bacterial species.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Campylobacter jejuni isolates (n = 234) associated with gastroenteritis and the Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in the island of Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles, and collected from March 1999 to March 2000 were investigated by a range of molecular typing techniques. Data obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), automated ribotyping, and sequence analysis of the short variable region of the flagellin gene (flaA) were analyzed separately and in combination. Similar groupings were obtained by all methods, with the data obtained by MLST and AFLP analysis exhibiting the highest degree of congruency. MLST identified 29 sequence types, which were assigned to 10 major clonal complexes. PFGE, AFLP analysis, and ribotyping identified 10, 9, and 8 of these clonal groups, respectively; however, these three techniques permitted subdivision of the clonal groups into more different types. Members of seven clonal groups comprising 107 isolates were obtained from November 1999 to February 2000, and no distinguishing characteristics were identified for two GBS-associated strains. The sequence type 41 (ST-41), ST-508, and ST-657 clonal complexes and their corresponding AFLP types have been rare or absent in the Campylobacter data sets described to date. We conclude that several clonal complexes of C. jejuni are associated with human disease in Curaçao, and some of these have not been reported elsewhere. Furthermore, given the observation that C. jejuni-associated diseases appear to be more severe from November to February, it can be speculated that this may be due to the presence of virulent clones with a limited span of circulation.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Invasive meningococcal disease causes over 3500 cases each year in Europe, with particularly high incidence among young children. Among serogroup B meningococci, which cause most of the cases, high diversity in the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) is observed in endemic situations; however, comprehensive molecular epidemiological data are available for the diversity and distribution of the OMPs PorA and FetA and these can be used to rationally design a vaccine with high coverage of the case isolates. The aim of this study was to determine whether outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) derived from an isolate with constitutive FetA expression (MenPF-1 vaccine) could be used to induce antibodies against both the PorA and FetA antigens. The immunogenicity of various dose levels and number of doses was evaluated in mice and rabbits, and IgG antibody responses tested against OMVs and recombinant PorA and FetA proteins. A panel of four isogenic mutants was generated and used to evaluate the relative ability of the vaccine to induce serum bactericidal activity (SBA) against FetA and PorA. Sera from mice were tested in SBA against the four target strains. Results demonstrated that the MenPF-1 OMVs were immunogenic against PorA and FetA in both animal models. Furthermore, the murine antibodies induced were bactericidal against isogenic mutant strains, suggesting that antibodies to both PorA and FetA were functional. The data presented indicate that the MenPF-1 vaccine is a suitable formulation for presenting PorA and FetA OMPs in order to induce bactericidal antibodies, and that proceeding to a Phase I clinical trial with this vaccine candidate is justified.",

        "abstract": "Establishing sources of human infection supports effective disease control measures. Host association with Campylobacter jejuni was analyzed by using multilocus sequence typing data for 713 isolates from chickens and bovids (cattle and sheep). Commonly used summary measures of genotypes (sequence type and clonal complex) showed poor accuracy, but a method using the full allelic profile showed 80% accuracy in distinguishing isolates from these 2 host groups. We explored the biologic basis of more accurate results with allelic profiles. Strains isolated from specific hosts have imported a substantial number of alleles while circulating in those host species. These results imply that 1) although Campylobacter moves frequently between hosts, most transmission is within species, and 2) lineages can acquire a host signature and potentially adapt to the host through recombination. Assignment using this signature enables improved prediction of source for pathogens that undergo frequent genetic recombination.",

        "abstract": "South Australia (SA) has the highest notification rate of invasive meningococcal disease in Australia with the majority of cases due to serogroup B. Neisseria meningitidis is carried in the pharynx, with adolescents having the highest rates of carriage. A vaccine designed to offer protection against serogroup B (4CMenB) is licensed in Australia. The SA MenB vaccine carriage study aims to assess the impact of 4CMenB on carriage of N. meningitidis in adolescents. This is a parallel cluster randomised controlled trial enrolling year 10, 11 and 12 school students (approximately 16–18 years of age) throughout SA, in metropolitan and rural/remote areas. Schools are randomised to intervention (4CMenB vaccination at baseline) or control (4CMenB vaccination at study completion) with randomisation stratified by school size and socioeconomic status, as measured by the Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage (Australian Curriculum). Oropharyngeal swabs will be taken from all students at visit 1, and 12 months later from year 11 and 12 students. Students unvaccinated in 2017 will receive vaccine at the 12-month follow-up. Carriage prevalence of N. meningitidis will be determined by PCR at baseline and 12 months following 4CMenB vaccination and compared with carriage prevalence at 12 months in unvaccinated students. A questionnaire will be completed at baseline and 12 months to assess risk factors associated with carriage. The primary outcome of carriage prevalence of disease causing N. meningitidis at 12 months will be compared between groups using logistic regression, with generalised estimating equations used to account for clustering at the school level. The difference in carriage prevalence between groups will be expressed as an OR with 95% CI. The study was approved by the Women’s and Children’s Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee (WCHN HREC). The protocol, informed consent forms, recruitment materials, social media and all participant materials have been reviewed and approved by the WCHN HREC and updated on ClinicalTrials.gov. Results will be published in international peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences. The study findings will be provided in public forums and to study participants and participating schools.",

        "abstract": "Some transformable bacteria have acquired target-mediated antibiotic resistance by horizontal genetic exchange of fragments of chromosomal genes. The resistant strains express variants of the antibiotic target that are metabolically active but exhibit a lowered affinity for the antibiotic. The alleles encoding these resistant proteins are mosaics comprising DNA derived from the host and other bacteria, often members of a different species. Examples include penicillin-resistant penicillinbinding proteins (PBPs) in Streptococcus pneumoniae and the pathogenic Neisseria species and sulfonamide-resistant dihydropterate synthase in Neisseria meningitidis. Distinct mosaic alleles encoding antibiotic resistance have arisen on multiple occasions, indicating the mobility of chromosomal genes in these species. Mosaic genes can arise at any chromosomal locus, and S. pneumoniae organisms with high-level penicillin resistance have acquired mosaic PBP genes at three separate pbp loci. Furthermore, horizontal genetic exchange permits movement of alleles among bacterial lineages, increasing the opportunities for the spread of antibiotic resistance.",

        "abstract": "Herd immunity is important in the effectiveness of conjugate polysaccharide vaccines against encapsulated bacteria. A large multicenter study investigated the effect of meningococcal serogroup C conjugate vaccine introduction on the meningococcal population. Carried meningococci in individuals aged 15–19 years attending education establishments were investigated before and for 2 years after vaccine introduction. Isolates were characterized by multilocus sequence typing, serogroup, and capsular region genotype and changes in phenotypes and genotypes assessed. A total of 8462 meningococci were isolated from 47 765 participants (17.7%). Serogroup prevalence was similar over the 3 years, except for decreases of 80% for serogroup C and 40% for serogroup 29E. Clonal complexes were associated with particular serogroups and their relative proportions fluctuated, with 12 statistically significant changes (6 up, 6 down). The reduction of ST-11 complex serogroup C meningococci was probably due to vaccine introduction. Reasons for a decrease in serogroup 29E ST-254 meningococci (from 1.8% to 0.7%) and an increase in serogroup B ST-213 complex meningococci (from 6.7% to 10.6%) were less clear. Natural fluctuations in carried meningococcal genotypes and phenotypes a can be affected by the use of conjugate vaccines, and not all of these changes are anticipatable in advance of vaccine introduction.",

        "abstract": "Subtypes, defined by variation in the outer membrane protein PorA, are an integral part of the characterization scheme for Neisseria meningitidis. Identification of these variants remains important as the PorA protein is a major immunogenic component of several meningococcal vaccines under development, and characteristics of PorA are used to provide detailed epidemiologic information. Historically, serosubtypes have been defined by reactivity with a set of monoclonal antibodies. However, nucleotide sequence analyses of porA genes have established that the panel of serosubtyping monoclonal antibodies is not exhaustive and many porA variants cannot be detected. In addition, the nomenclature system used to define subtypes is inadequate. We examined all available nucleotide sequences of the porA VR1 and VR2 regions to identify and define subtype families. A revised nomenclature scheme, compatible with the previous serologic nomenclature scheme, was devised. A Web-accessible database describing this nomenclature and its relationship to previous schemes was established (available from: http://neisseria.org/nm/typing/pora).",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Isolates of the zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter are generally considered to be unable to metabolize glucose due to lack of key glycolytic enzymes. However, the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway has been identified in Campylobacter jejuni subsp. doylei and a few C. coli isolates. A systematic search for ED pathway genes in a wide range of Campylobacter isolates and in the C. jejuni/coli PubMLST database revealed that 1.7% of >6,000 genomes encoded a complete ED pathway, including both C. jejuni and C. coli from diverse clinical, environmental and animal sources. In rich media, glucose significantly enhanced stationary phase survival of a set of ED-positive C. coli isolates. Unexpectedly, glucose massively promoted floating biofilm formation in some of these ED-positive isolates. Metabolic profiling by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry revealed distinct responses to glucose in a low biofilm strain (CV1257) compared to a high biofilm strain (B13117), consistent with preferential diversion of hexose-6-phosphate to polysaccharide in B13117. We conclude that while the ED pathway is rare amongst Campylobacter isolates causing human disease (the majority of which would be of agricultural origin), some glucose-utilizing isolates exhibit specific fitness advantages, including stationary-phase survival and biofilm production, highlighting key physiological benefits of this pathway in addition to energy conservation.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is increasing among clinical Campylobacter cases and is common among isolates from other sources, specifically retail poultry - a major source of human infection. In this study the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates from a UK-wide survey of Campylobacter in retail poultry in 2001 and 2004–5 was investigated. The occurrence of phenotypes resistant to tetracycline, quinolones (ciprofloxacin and naladixic acid), erythromycin, chloramphenicol and aminoglycosides was quantified. This was compared with a phylogeny for these isolates based upon Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) to investigate the pattern of antimicrobial resistance acquisition. Antimicrobial resistance was present in all lineage clusters, but statistical testing showed a non-random distribution. Erythromycin resistance was associated with Campylobacter coli. For all antimicrobials tested, resistant isolates were distributed among relatively distant lineages indicative of widespread acquisition. There was also evidence of clustering of resistance phenotypes within lineages; indicative of local expansion of resistant strains. These results are consistent with the widespread acquisition of antimicrobial resistance among chicken associated Campylobacter isolates, either through mutation or horizontal gene transfer, and the expansion of these lineages as a proportion of the population. As Campylobacter are not known to multiply outside of the host and long-term carriage in humans is extremely infrequent in industrialized countries, the most likely location for the proliferation of resistant lineages is in farmed chickens.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "A carriage study was undertaken (n = 112) to ascertain the prevalence of Neisseria spp. following the eighth case of invasive meningococcal disease in young children (5 to 46 months) and members of a large extended indigenous ethnic minority Traveller family (n = 123), typically associated with high-occupancy living conditions. Nested multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was employed for case specimen extracts. Isolates were genome sequenced and then were assembled de novo and deposited into the Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequencing Database (BIGSdb). This facilitated an expanded MLST approach utilizing large numbers of loci for isolate characterization and discrimination. A rare sequence type, ST-6697, predominated in disease specimens and isolates that were carried (n = 8/14), persisting for at least 44 months, likely driven by the high population density of houses (n = 67/112) and trailers (n = 45/112). Carriage for Neisseria meningitidis (P < 0.05) and Neisseria lactamica (P < 0.002) (2-sided Fisher's exact test) was more likely in the smaller, more densely populated trailers. Meningococcal carriage was highest in 24- to 39-year-olds (45%, n = 9/20). Evidence of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) was observed in four individuals cocolonized by Neisseria lactamica and Neisseria meningitidis. One HGT event resulted in the acquisition of 26 consecutive N. lactamica alleles. This study demonstrates how housing density can drive meningococcal transmission and carriage, which likely facilitated the persistence of ST-6697 and prolonged the outbreak. Whole-genome MLST effectively distinguished between highly similar outbreak strain isolates, including those isolated from person-to-person transmission, and also highlighted how a few HGT events can distort the true phylogenetic relationship between highly similar clonal isolates.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Genetic attribution of bacterial genotypes has become a major tool in the investigation of the epidemiology of campylobacteriosis and has implicated retail chicken meat as the major source of human infection in several countries. To investigate the robustness of this approach to the provenance of the reference data sets used, a collection of 742 Campylobacter jejuni and 261 Campylobacter coli isolates obtained from United Kingdom-sourced chicken meat was established and typed by multilocus sequence typing. Comparative analyses of the data with those from other isolates sourced from a variety of host animals and countries were undertaken by genetic attribution, genealogical, and population genetic approaches. The genotypes from the United Kingdom data set were highly diverse, yet structured into sequence types, clonal complexes, and genealogical groups very similar to those seen in chicken isolates from the Netherlands, the United States, and Senegal, but more distinct from isolates obtained from ruminant, swine, and wild bird sources. Assignment analyses consistently grouped isolates from different host animal sources regardless of geographical source; these associations were more robust than geographic associations across isolates from three continents. We conclude that, notwithstanding the high diversity of these pathogens, there is a strong signal of association of multilocus genotypes with particular hosts, which is greater than the geographic signal. These findings are consistent with local and international transmission of host-associated lineages among food animal species and provide a foundation for further improvements in genetic attribution.",

This evaluation is divided in two parts. First, commonly used molecular typing methods are assessed against a set of predefined criteria relating to discriminatory power, reproducibility, repeatability and current or potential suitability for international harmonisation. Secondly, the methods are evaluated regarding their appropriateness for use in different public health-related applications. These applications include outbreak detection and investigation, attribution modelling, the potential for early identification of food-borne clones with epidemic potential and the integration of the resulting data in risk assessment. The results of these evaluations provide updated insights into the potential use of molecular characterisation methods, including whole genome sequencing technologies, in microbial food safety. Recommendations are also made in order to encourage a holistic and structured approach to the use of molecular characterisation methods for food-borne pathogens; in particular, on the importance of structured co-ordination at international level to help overcome current limitations in harmonisation of data analysis and interpretation.",

Today, in the whole-genome era of microbiology, the need for systematic, standardized descriptions of bacterial genotypic variation remains a priority. Here, to meet this need, we draw on the successes of MLST and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to propose a hierarchical gene-by-gene approach that reflects functional and evolutionary relationships and catalogues bacteria 'from domain to strain'.

        "abstract": "Hyperinvasive lineages of Neisseria meningitidis, which persist despite extensive horizontal genetic exchange, are a major cause of meningitis and septicaemia worldwide. Over the past 50 years one such lineage of meningococci, known as serogroup A, clonal complex 5 (A:cc5), has caused three successive pandemics, including epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. Although the principal antigens that invoke effective immunity have remained unchanged, distinct A:cc5 epidemic clones have nevertheless emerged. An analysis of whole genome sequence diversity among 153 A:cc5 isolates identified eleven genetic introgression events in the emergence of the epidemic clones, which primarily involved variants of core genes encoding metabolic processes. The acquired DNA was identical to that found over many years in other, unrelated, hyperinvasive meningococci, suggesting that the epidemic clones emerged by acquisition of pre-existing metabolic gene variants, rather than ‘virulence’ associated or antigen-encoding genes. This is consistent with mathematical models which predict the association of transmission fitness with the emergence and maintenance of virulence in recombining commensal organisms.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Unlike other meningococcal serogroups, major cross-reactive antigens suitable for inclusion in human vaccines that convey broad protection have not been identified for meningococci expressing serogroup B capsules. Vaccine development is therefore currently dominated by two main approaches. The first relies on the inclusion of multiple conserved ‘minor’ (i.e., expressed at low levels) antigens to achieve immunogenicity across a broad range of strains, and to reduce the risk of emerging strains with novel antigenic combinations [1,21]. To date, the type and number of antigens needed to achieve either goal is not known. The main alternative is the use of multivalent PorA-based OMV vaccines. Similar questions about the number of valencies needed to achieve broad coverage and prevent emergent strains need to be answered, and periodic modifications to adjust to changing MenB epidemiology may be required. Multivalent PorA-based vaccines can be further improved by additional components such as FrpB (FetA) and/or fHbp. The leading candidate rMenB-OMV vaccine will probably offer a reasonable level of protection in older children/adolescents but, although capable of inducing bactericidal antibodies in infants, the available data do not convincingly demonstrate that the vaccine will be broadly protective in the very young, and the role of each component in terms of immunogenic and protective potential is undefined. The addition of P1.7,4 OMV has increased coverage of the poorly immunogenic subunit proteins in pediatric populations. The bivalent fHbp (LP2086) vaccine still needs to be evaluated in a pediatric study. To achieve high coverage, a subunit MenB vaccine appears to need a high valency of minor subunit proteins. OMV technology has been available for 20 years and OMV vaccines have proved efficacious in preventing MenB disease in regions where a single strain predominates. Efforts to increase the coverage offered by OMVs via multivalent approaches or combining subunit antigens with less reactogenic, modified OMVs appears an alternative pathway towards a MenB vaccine, although these vaccines could need some adaptation of composition over time. Group B meningococci remain a cause of devastating disease and research should continue to offer public health vaccines.",

        "abstract": "The eubacterial genus Wolbachia comprises one of the most abundant groups of obligate intracellular bacteria, and it has a host range that spans the phyla Arthropoda and Nematoda. Here we developed a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme as a universal genotyping tool for Wolbachia. Internal fragments of five ubiquitous genes (gatB, coxA, hcpA, fbpA, and ftsZ) were chosen, and primers that amplified across the major Wolbachia supergroups found in arthropods, as well as other divergent lineages, were designed. A supplemental typing system using the hypervariable regions of the Wolbachia surface protein (WSP) was also developed. Thirty-seven strains belonging to supergroups A, B, D, and F obtained from singly infected hosts were characterized by using MLST and WSP. The number of alleles per MLST locus ranged from 25 to 31, and the average levels of genetic diversity among alleles were 6.5% to 9.2%. A total of 35 unique allelic profiles were found. The results confirmed that there is a high level of recombination in chromosomal genes. MLST was shown to be effective for detecting diversity among strains within a single host species, as well as for identifying closely related strains found in different arthropod hosts. Identical or similar allelic profiles were obtained for strains harbored by different insect species and causing distinct reproductive phenotypes. Strains with similar WSP sequences can have very different MLST allelic profiles and vice versa, indicating the importance of the MLST approach for strain identification. The MLST system provides a universal and unambiguous tool for strain typing, population genetics, and molecular evolutionary studies",

PubMed and Web of Science were searched in July 2018 using the terms ‘meningococcal OR Neisseria meningitidis OR lactamica AND carriage AND Africa’, with the search limited to papers published on or after 1st January 2007. We conducted a narrative review of these publications. One hundred and thirteen papers were identified using the search terms described above, 20 of which reported new data from surveys conducted in an African meningitis belt country. These papers described 40 surveys conducted before the introduction of the group A meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenAfriVacR) during which 66 707 pharyngeal swabs were obtained. Carriage prevalence of N. meningitidis varied substantially by time and place, ranging from <1% to 24%. The mean pharyngeal carriage prevalence of N. meningitidis across all surveys was 4.5% [95% CI: 3.4%, 6.8%] and that of capsulated N. meningitidis was 2.8% [95% CI: 1.9%; 5.2%]. A study of households provided strong evidence for meningococcal transmission within and outside households. The introduction of MenAfriVac® led to marked reductions in carriage of the serogroup A meningococcus in Burkina Faso and Chad. Recent studies employing standardised methods confirm the findings of older studies that carriage of N. meningitidis in the African meningitis belt is highly variable over time and place, but generally occurs with a lower prevalence and shorter duration than reported from industrialised countries.",

        "abstract": "To determine the diversity and population structure of Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) isolates from Danish patients and to examine the association between multilocus sequence typing types and different clinical symptoms including gastroenteritis (GI), Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) and reactive arthritis (RA). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was used to characterize 122 isolates, including 18 from patients with RA and 8 from patients with GBS. The GI and RA isolates were collected in Denmark during 2002–2003 and the GBS isolates were obtained from other countries. In overall, 51 sequence types (STs) were identified within 18 clonal complexes (CCs). Of these three CCs, ST‐21, ST‐45 and ST‐22 clonal complexes accounted for 64 percent of all isolates. The GBS isolates in this study significantly grouped into the ST‐22 clonal complex, consistent with the PubMLST database isolates. There was no significant clustering of the RA isolates. Isolates from Denmark were found to be highly genetically diverse. GBS isolates grouped significantly with clonal complex ST‐22, but the absence of clustering of RA isolates indicated that the phylogenetic background for this sequela could not be reconstructed using variation in MLST loci. Possibly, putative RA‐associated genes may vary, by recombination or expression differences, independent of MLST loci. MLST typing of C. jejuni isolates from Danish patients with gastroenteritis confirmed that the diversity of clones in Denmark is comparable to that in other European countries. Furthermore, a verification of the grouping of GBS isolates compared to RA isolates provides information about evolution of the bacterial population resulting in this important sequela.",

Available conjugate vaccines target only a small subset (up to 13) of >90 known capsular serotypes of S. pneumoniae and, since their introduction, increases in non-vaccine serotypes have been recorded in several countries: a phenomenon termed Vaccine Induced Serotype Replacement (VISR). Here, using a combination of mathematical modelling and whole genome analysis, we show that targeting particular serotypes through vaccination can also cause their metabolic and virulence-associated components to transfer through recombination to non-vaccine serotypes: a phenomenon we term Vaccine-Induced Metabolic Shift (VIMS). Our results provide a novel explanation for changes observed in the population structure of the pneumococcus following vaccination, and have important implications for strain-targeted vaccination in a range of infectious disease systems.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Neisseria meningitidis is a human-specific bacterium that varies in invasive potential. All meningococci are carried in the nasopharynx, and most genotypes are very infrequently associated with invasive meningococcal disease; however, those belonging to the ‘hyperinvasive lineages’ are more frequently associated with sepsis or meningitis. Genome content is highly conserved between carriage and disease isolates, and differential gene expression has been proposed as a major determinant of the hyperinvasive phenotype. Three phase variable DNA methyltransferases (ModA, ModB and ModD), which mediate epigenetic regulation of distinct phase variable regulons (phasevarions), have been identified in N. meningitidis. Each mod gene has distinct alleles, defined by their Mod DNA recognition domain, and these target and methylate different DNA sequences, thereby regulating distinct gene sets. Here 211 meningococcal carriage and >1,400 disease isolates were surveyed for the distribution of meningococcal mod alleles. While modA11-12 and modB1-2 were found in most isolates, rarer alleles (e.g., modA15, modB4, modD1-6) were specific to particular genotypes as defined by clonal complex. This suggests that phase variable Mod proteins may be associated with distinct phenotypes and hence invasive potential of N. meningitidis strains.",

The Campylobacter genotypes isolated before and after slaughter were diverse, with up to five sequence types (STs) (seven-locus allelic profiles resulting from MLST) identified per live bird, up to eight STs identified per carcass and 31 STs identified in all. The majority (72.0%) of isolates sampled from carcasses post-slaughter were indistinguishable from those isolated from the live flock before slaughter by ST and flaA SVR type, however, sampling ‘on-farm’ failed to capture all of the diversity seen post-slaughter. There were statistically significant increases in the genetic diversity of Campylobacter (p = 0.005) and the proportion of C. coli (p = 0.002), with some evidence for differential survival of genotypes contaminating the end product. C. coli genotypes isolated after slaughter were more similar to those from free-range and organic meat products sampled nationally, than from the live flock sampled previously.

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Cattle are the second most common source of human campylobacteriosis. However, routes to account for this scale of transmission have not been identified. In contrast to chicken, red meat is not heavily contaminated at point of sale. Although effective pasteurization prevents milk-borne infection, apparently sporadic infections may include undetected outbreaks from raw or perhaps incompletely pasteurized milk. A rise in Campylobacter gastroenteritis in an isolated population was investigated using whole-genome sequencing (WGS), an epidemiological study, and environmental investigations. A single strain was identified in 20 cases, clearly distinguishable from other local strains and a reference population by WGS. A case-case analysis showed association of infection with the outbreak strain and milk from a single dairy (odds ratio, 8; Fisher exact test P value = .023). Despite temperature records indicating effective pasteurization, mechanical faults likely to lead to incomplete pasteurization of part of the milk were identified by further testing and examination of internal components of dairy equipment. Here, milk distribution concentrated on a small area, including school-aged children with low background incidence of campylobacteriosis, facilitated outbreak identification. Low-level contamination of widely distributed milk would not produce as detectable an outbreak signal. Such hidden outbreaks may contribute to the substantial burden of apparently sporadic Campylobacter from cattle where transmission routes are not certain. The effective discrimination of outbreak isolates from a reference population using WGS shows that integrating these data and approaches into surveillance could support the detection as well as investigation of such outbreaks.",

Acquisition of meningococcal carriage peaked in school age children. Recent symptoms of sore throat during the dry season, but not during the rainy season, were associated with a higher risk of acquisition.

        "abstract": "The genetic diversity of Campylobacter jejuni isolates from farm animals and their environment was investigated by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). A total of 30 genotypes, defined by allelic profiles (assigned to sequence types [STs]), were found in 112 C. jejuni isolates originating in poultry, cattle, sheep, starlings, and slurry. All but two of these genotypes belonged to one of nine C. jejuni clonal complexes previously identified in isolates from human disease and retail food samples and one clonal complex previously associated with an environmental source. There was some evidence for the association of certain clonal complexes with particular farm animals: isolates belonging to the ST-45 complex predominated among poultry isolates but were absent among sheep isolates, while isolates belonging to the ST-61 and ST-42 complexes were predominant among sheep isolates but were absent from the poultry isolates. In contrast, ST-21 complex isolates were distributed among the different isolation sources. Comparison with MLST data from 91 human disease isolates showed small but significant genetic differentiation between the farm and human isolates; however, representatives of six clonal complexes were found in both samples. These data demonstrate that MLST and the clonal complex model can be used to identify and compare the genotypes of C. jejuni isolates from farm animals and the environment with those from retail food and human disease.",

        "abstract": "Serogroup B invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is increasing in China, but little is known about the causative meningococci. Here, IMD and carriage isolates in Shanghai characterised and the applicability of different vaccines assessed. Seven IMD epidemic periods have been observed in Shanghai since 1950, with 460 isolates collected including 169 from IMD and 291 from carriage. Analyses were divided according to the period of meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPV) introduction: (i) pre-MPV-A, 1965–1980; (ii) post-MPV-A, 1981–2008; and (iii) post-MPV-A + C, 2009–2016. Over this period, IMD incidence decreased from 55.4/100,000 to 0.71 then to 0.02, corresponding to successive changes in meningococcal type from serogroup A ST-5 complex (MenA:cc5) to MenC:cc4821, and finally MenB:cc4821. MenB IMD became predominant (63.2%) in the post-MPV-A + C period, and 50% of cases were caused by cc4821, with the highest incidence in infants (0.45/100,000) and a case-fatality rate of 9.5%. IMD was positively correlated with population carriage rates. Using the Bexsero Antigen Sequence Type (BAST) system, fewer than 25% of MenB isolates in the post-MPV-A + C period contained exact or predicted cross reactive matches to the vaccines Bexsero, Trumenba, or an outer membrane vesicle (OMV)-based vaccine, NonaMen. A unique IMD epidemiology was seen in China, changing periodically from epidemic to hyperepidemic and low-level endemic disease. At the time of writing, MenB IMD dominated IMD in Shanghai, with isolates potentially beyond coverage with licenced OMV- and protein-based MenB vaccines.",

        "abstract": "The continued evolution of bacterial pathogens has major implications for both human and animal disease, but the exchange of genetic material between host-restricted pathogens is rarely considered. Streptococcus equi subspecies equi (S. equi) is a host-restricted pathogen of horses that has evolved from the zoonotic pathogen Streptococcus equi subspecies zooepidemicus (S. zooepidemicus). These pathogens share approximately 80% genome sequence identity with the important human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes. We sequenced and compared the genomes of S. equi 4047 and S. zooepidemicus H70 and screened S. equi and S. zooepidemicus strains from around the world to uncover evidence of the genetic events that have shaped the evolution of the S. equi genome and led to its emergence as a host-restricted pathogen. Our analysis provides evidence of functional loss due to mutation and deletion, coupled with pathogenic specialization through the acquisition of bacteriophage encoding a phospholipase A2 toxin, and four superantigens, and an integrative conjugative element carrying a novel iron acquisition system with similarity to the high pathogenicity island of Yersinia pestis. We also highlight that S. equi, S. zooepidemicus, and S. pyogenes share a common phage pool that enhances cross-species pathogen evolution. We conclude that the complex interplay of functional loss, pathogenic specialization, and genetic exchange between S. equi, S. zooepidemicus, and S. pyogenes continues to influence the evolution of these important streptococci.",

        "abstract": "Fingerprint patterns were generated from strains of Neisseria meningitidis by digestion of chromosomal DNA samples with ‘rare-site’ restriction endonucleases and resolution of the resultant fragments by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The potential of this technique for the rapid establishment of the clonal relationships between different isolates of the meningococcus was investigated. The fingerprint patterns from various serogroup A strains, previously assigned to clonal subgroups on the basis of their electrophoretic types (ETs), were compared. Fingerprints generated with the endonucleases SfiI, SpeI and NheI each gave distinctive patterns for the clonal subgroups I-IV of serogroup A. Further, the endonucleases Spel and, particularly, NheI were capable of resolving differences between various subgroup III strains isolated at different times and geographical locations. Strains isolated during the ‘new wave’ pandemic, which was associated with the Haj, from Europe, America, and Africa, had a characteristic fingerprint pattern and appeared to be distinct from ‘old wave’ pandemic strains. The PFGE technique is a relatively rapid and sensitive method for establishing clonal relationships among epidemic strains of N. meningitidis.",

        "abstract": "Meningococcal disease remains a major childhood infection in Europe, with an appreciable number of cases in other age groups, notably young adults. Despite the introduction of a conjugate vaccine against serogroup C meningococcal disease, there currently exists no universal childhood vaccine. Thus the severity of the disease, combined with its rapid progression and nonspecific symptoms, continues to result in an unacceptable level of childhood morbidity and mortality. The development of effective vaccines, as well as of public health management policies, are confounded by the epidemiology of meningococal disease, which is governed by the complex population biology of the causative organism, Neisseria meningitidis . In addition to its public health significance, meningococcal disease is a valuable scientific model system and a paradigm for pan-European co-operation among publicly funded laboratories. An improved understanding of disease dissemination has been an urgent priority for advancing public health and clinical management throughout Europe. In the past, networks for the epidemiological surveillance of meningococcal disease have been established in order to provide prerequisites for the appropriate preventive measures for disease control. One of these networks, EU-IBIS, aims to improve epidemiological information on invasive meningococcal disease within Europe and to improve laboratory capacity for the accurate and quality-controlled characterization of meningococcal isolates. This network also provides a unique platform for scientific exchange, including non-EU countries and candidate EU countries ( http://www.euibis.org/ ), and collaborates with the European national reference laboratories organized in the European Monitoring Group on Meningococci (EMGM).

        "abstract": "Effective vaccines provide direct protection to immunized individuals, but may also provide benefits to unvaccinated individuals by reducing transmission and thereby lowering the risk of infection. Such herd immunity effects have been demonstrated following the introduction of meningococcal serogroup C conjugate (MCC) vaccines, with reductions in disease attack rates in unimmunized individuals and significantly lower serogroup C carriage attributable to the vaccine introduction. In the UK, targeting teenagers for immunization was crucial in maximizing indirect effects, as most meningococcal transmission occurs in this age group. Questions remain regarding the duration of herd protection and the most appropriate long-term immunization strategies. The magnitude of the herd effects following MCC vaccination was largely unanticipated, and has important consequences for the design and evaluation of new meningococcal vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Multilocus sequence analysis of 417 strains of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis revealed that it is a complex of four populations, three of which have been previously assigned species status [Y. pseudotuberculosis sensu stricto (s.s.), Yersinia pestis and Yersinia similis] and a fourth population, which we refer to as the Korean group, which may be in the process of speciation. We detected clear signs of recombination within Y. pseudotuberculosis s.s. as well as imports from Y. similis and the Korean group. The sources of genetic diversification within Y. pseudotuberculosis s.s. were approximately equally divided between recombination and mutation, whereas recombination has not yet been demonstrated in Y. pestis, which is also much more genetically monomorphic than is Y. pseudotuberculosis s.s. Most Y. pseudotuberculosis s.s. belong to a diffuse group of sequence types lacking clear population structure, although this species contains a melibiose‐negative clade that is present globally in domesticated animals. Yersinia  similis corresponds to the previously identified Y. pseudotuberculosis genetic type G4, which is probably not pathogenic because it lacks the virulence factors that are typical for Y. pseudotuberculosis s.s. In contrast, Y. pseudotuberculosis s.s., the Korean group and Y. pestis can all cause disease in humans.",

Preparations that had received no ribonuclease treatment had 2-3% residual RNA contamination and predigestion of samples with RNase A, which only partially degraded the RNA present in the crude extracts, resulted in LOS samples contaminated with 15-20% residual RNA. The LOS purified from RNase ONE-treated extracts was highly endotoxic, and showed no reduction in antibody binding or specific endotoxin activity compared to unpurified material. Approximately 80% of the LOS applied to the chromatography column was recovered as purified material.",

        "abstract": "Information on transmission of meningococcal infection in the African meningitis belt is scarce. We aimed to describe transmission patterns of Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) in households in the African meningitis belt. Cross-sectional carriage surveys were done in seven African meningitis belt countries (Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, and Senegal) between Aug 1, 2010, and Oct 15, 2012. Meningococcal carriers identified in these surveys and all available people in their households were recruited into this longitudinal cohort study. We took pharyngeal swabs at first visit and took further swabs twice a month for 2 months and then monthly for a further 4 months. We used conventional bacteriological and molecular techniques to identify and characterise meningococci. We estimated the rates of carriage acquisition and recovery using a multi-state Markov model. Meningococci were isolated from 241 (25%) of 980 members of 133 households in which a carrier had been identified in the cross-sectional survey or at the first household visit. Carriage was detected subsequently in another household member who was not an index carrier in 75 households. Transmission within a household, suggested by detection of a further carrier with the same strain as the index carrier, was found in 52 of these 75 households. Children younger than 5 years were the group that most frequently acquired carriage from other household members. The overall individual acquisition rate was 2·4% (95% CI 1·6–4·0) per month, varying by age and household carriage status. The mean duration of carriage was 3·4 months (95% CI 2·7–4·4). In the African meningitis belt, transmission of meningococci within households is important, particularly for young children, and periods of carriage are usually of short duration.",

We present an association mapping method that takes into account the clonal population structure of bacteria and is applicable to both core and accessory genome variation. Campylobacter is a common cause of human gastroenteritis as a consequence of its proliferation in multiple farm animal species and its transmission via contaminated meat and poultry. We applied our association mapping method to identify the factors responsible for adaptation to cattle and chickens among 192 Campylobacter isolates from these and other host sources. Phylogenetic analysis implied frequent host switching but also showed that some lineages were strongly associated with particular hosts. A seven-gene region with a host association signal was found. Genes in this region were almost universally present in cattle but were frequently absent in isolates from chickens and wild birds. Three of the seven genes encoded vitamin B5 biosynthesis. We found that isolates from cattle were better able to grow in vitamin B5-depleted media and propose that this difference may be an adaptation to host diet.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the population genetics in collections of meningococci sampled in Cuba during the period 1983–2005, thereby covering a period before and after the introduction of an antimeningococcal B–C vaccine. A total of 163 case isolates and 210 isolates from healthy carriers were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and sequence determination of porA, porB and fetA genes. A total of 56 sequence types (STs) including 28 new STs were identified among these isolates. The analysis of surface antigens revealed variants 3-1 and 3-8 to be prevalent for porB; variant F5-1 was the most common FetA epitope, and variants 19 and 15 corresponded to the prevalent variable regions 1 (VR1) and VR2 PorA epitopes, respectively. The strongest associations between specific surface protein variants and clonal complexes were detected in lineages ST-32 and ST-53. All ST-32 complex isolates possessed porB3 alleles, and the most frequent antigen combination among ST-32 complex isolates was P1.19,15;F5-1. Variants PorB3-64 at PorB and P1.30 at PorA VR2, in combination with the PorA VR1 variants P1.12-1, P1.7 and P1.7-2 as well as the FetA variants F1-2 and F1-7, dominated the ST-53 complex organisms. Furthermore, we observed a statistically significant association between the most frequent porA, porB and fetA alleles and strain invasiveness. Finally, this study showed that the application of VA-MENGOC-BC®, the Cuban antimeningococcal vaccine, reduced the number and frequency of the hypervirulent Clonal Complexes ST-32 and ST-41/44, and also impacted on other lineages. The vaccine also affected the genetic composition of the carrier-associated meningococcal isolates. The number of carrier isolates belonging to hypervirulent lineages decreased significantly after vaccination, and ST-53, a sequence type common in carriers, became the predominant ST.",

        "abstract": "Three closely related bacterial species within the genus Neisseria are of importance to human disease and health. Neisseria meningitidis is a major cause of meningitis, while Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the agent of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea and Neisseria lactamica is a common, harmless commensal of children. Comparative genomics have yet to yield clear insights into which factors dictate the unique host-parasite relationships exhibited by each since, as a group, they display remarkable conservation at the levels of nucleotide sequence, gene content and synteny. Here, we discovered two rare alterations in the gene encoding the CcoP protein component of cytochrome cbb 3 oxidase that are phylogenetically informative. One is a single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in CcoP truncation that acts as a molecular signature for the species N. meningitidis. We go on to show that the ancestral ccoP gene arose by a unique gene duplication and fusion event and is specifically and completely distributed within species of the genus Neisseria. Surprisingly, we found that strains engineered to express either of the two CcoP forms conditionally differed in their capacity to support nitrite-dependent, microaerobic growth mediated by NirK, a nitrite reductase. Thus, we propose that changes in CcoP domain architecture and ensuing alterations in function are key traits in successive, adaptive radiations within these metapopulations. These findings provide a dramatic example of how rare changes in core metabolic proteins can be connected to significant macroevolutionary shifts. They also show how evolutionary change at the molecular level can be linked to metabolic innovation and its reversal as well as demonstrating how genotype can be used to infer alterations of the fitness landscape within a single host.",

        "abstract": "A multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme that uses the same loci as a previously described system for Campylobacter jejuni was developed for Campylobacter coli. The C. coli-specific primers were validated with 53 isolates from humans, chickens, and pigs, together with 15 Penner serotype reference isolates. The nucleotide sequence of the flaA short variable region (SVR) was determined for each isolate. These sequence data were compared to equivalent information for 17 C. jejuni isolates representing the known genetic diversity of this species. C. coli and C. jejuni share approximately 86.5% identity at the nucleotide sequence level within the MLST loci. There is evidence of genetic exchange of the housekeeping genes between the two species, but at a very low rate; only one sequence type from each species showed evidence of imported DNA. The flaA gene was more variable and has been exchanged many times between the two species, making it an unreliable marker for species identification but useful for distinguishing closely related strains. All but 3 of 21 human C. coli clinical isolates were distinct, according to the combined MLST and SVR sequences. The use of a common MLST scheme allows direct comparisons of the population biology and molecular epidemiology of these two closely related human pathogens.",

        "abstract": "Invasive disease caused by the encapsulated bacteria Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, despite the introduction of successful conjugate polysaccharide vaccines that target disease-associated strains. In addition, resistance, or more accurately reduced susceptibility, to therapeutic antibiotics is spreading in populations of these organisms. There is therefore a continuing requirement for the surveillance of vaccine and non-vaccine antigens and antibiotic susceptibilities among isolates from invasive disease, which is only partially met by conventional methods. This need can be met with molecular and especially nucleotide sequence-based typing methods, which are fully developed in the case of N. meningitidis and which could be more widely deployed in clinical laboratories for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.",

        "abstract": "Of 830 Neisseria meningitidis isolates obtained from healthy carriers in Bavaria, Germany, 136 (16<4%) lacked the operons necessary for the synthesis, lipid modification, and transport of capsular polysaccharide. These operons were replaced by a non-coding intergenic region either 113 or 114 bp in length, termed here the capsule null locus (cnl). Comparisons of the nucleotide sequence of this region in the meningococcus and its acapsulate relatives, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria lactamica, revealed six distinct sequence variants (cnl-1 to cnl-6), with a total of 10 nucleotide substitutions and three indels. With the exception of one 4 bp insertion, which was unique to a gonococcal isolate, all of the individual sequence changes were present in the N. lactamica isolates examined. The meningococcal isolates with a cnl belonged to one of four otherwise genetically diverse genetic groupings: the ST-53 and ST-1117 complexes (75 isolates); the ST-845 complex (12 isolates); the ST-198 and 1136 complexes (46 isolates), and the ST-44 complex (one isolate). These data demonstrated that a substantial proportion of carried meningococci were incapable of capsule production, that the cnl circulated within Neisseria populations by horizontal genetic exchange, and that the expression of a polysaccharide capsule was not a requirement for person-to-person transmission of certain meningococcal lineages.",

        "abstract": "Most studies of bacterial pathogen populations have been based on isolates collected from individuals with disease, or their contacts, over short time periods. For commensal organisms that occasionally cause disease, such as Neisseria meningitidis, however, the analysis of isolates from long-term asymptomatic carriage is necessary to elucidate their evolution and population structure. Here, we use mathematical models to analyse the structuring and dynamics of three vaccine-candidate antigens among carried meningococcal isolates collected over nearly 30 years in the Czech Republic. The data indicate that stable combinations of antigenic alleles were maintained over this time period despite evidence for high rates of recombination, consistent with theoretical models in which strong immune selection can maintain non-overlapping combinations of antigenic determinants in the presence of recombination. We contrast this antigenic structure with the overlapping but relatively stable combinations of the housekeeping genes observed among the same isolates, and use a novel network approach to visualize these relationships.",

        "abstract": "Pathogenic Escherichia coli cause over 160 million cases of dysentery and one million deaths per year, whereas non‐pathogenic E. coli constitute part of the normal intestinal flora of healthy mammals and birds. The evolutionary pathways underlying this dichotomy in bacterial lifestyle were investigated by multilocus sequence typing of a global collection of isolates. Specific pathogen types [enterohaemorrhagic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enteroinvasive E. coli, K1 and Shigella] have arisen independently and repeatedly in several lineages, whereas other lineages contain only few pathogens. Rates of evolution have accelerated in pathogenic lineages, culminating in highly virulent organisms whose genomic contents are altered frequently by increased rates of homologous recombination; thus, the evolution of virulence is linked to bacterial sex. This long‐term pattern of evolution was observed in genes distributed throughout the genome, and thereby is the likely result of episodic selection for strains that can escape the host immune response.",

Furthermore, 92.4% of Campylobacter isolates from farmed ducks were sequence types (STs) commonly associated with human disease, in contrast to just one isolate from the wild ducks. Only one ST, ST‐45, was shared between the two sources, accounting for 0.9% of wild duck isolates and 5% of farmed duck isolates.

        "abstract": "Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was applied to 75 Candida albicans isolates, including 2 that were expected to be identical, 48 that came from diverse geographical and clinical sources, and 15 that were sequential isolates from two patients. DNA fragments (≈500 bp) of eight genes encoding housekeeping functions were sequenced, including four that have been described before for C. albicans MLST, and four new gene fragments, AAT1a, AAT1b, MPI, and ZWF1. In total, 87 polymorphic sites were found among 50 notionally different isolates, giving 46 unique sequence types, underlining the power of MLST to differentiate isolates for epidemiological studies. Additional typing information was obtained by detecting variations in size at the transcribed spacer region of the 25S rRNA gene and tests for homozygosity at the mating type-like (MTL) locus. The stability of MLST was confirmed in two sets of consecutive isolates from two patients. In each set the isolates were identical or varied by a single nucleotide. Reference strain SC5314 and a derived mutant, CAF2, gave identical MLST types. Heterozygous polymorphisms were found in at least one isolate for all but 16 (18.4%) of the variable nucleotides, and 35 (41%) of the 87 individual sequence changes generated nonsynonymous amino acids. Cloning and restriction digestion of a gene fragment containing heterozygous polymorphisms indicated that the heterozygosity was genuine and not the result of sequencing errors. Our data validate and extend previous MLST results for C. albicans, and we propose an optimized system based on sequencing eight gene fragments for routine MLST with this species.",

        "abstract": "Source attribution using molecular subtypes has implicated cattle and sheep as sources of human Campylobacter infection. Whether the Campylobacter subtypes associated with cattle and sheep vary spatiotemporally remains poorly known, especially at national levels. Here we describe spatiotemporal patterns of prevalence, bacterial enumeration, and subtype composition in Campylobacter isolates from cattle and sheep feces from northeastern (63 farms, 414 samples) and southwestern (71 farms, 449 samples) Scotland during 2005 to 2006. Isolates (201) were categorized as sequence type (ST), as clonal complex (CC), and as Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). No significant difference in average prevalence (cattle, 22%; sheep, 25%) or average enumeration (cattle, 2.7 × 104 CFU/g; sheep, 2.0 × 105 CFU/g) was found between hosts or regions. The four most common STs (C. jejuni ST-19, ST-42, and ST-61 and C. coli ST-827) occurred in both hosts, whereas STs of the C. coli ST-828 clonal complex were more common in sheep. Neither host yielded evidence for regional differences in ST, CC, or MLST allele composition. Isolates from the two hosts combined, categorized as ST or CC, were more similar within than between farms but showed no further spatiotemporal trends up to 330 km and 50 weeks between farm samples. In contrast, both regions yielded evidence for significant differences in ST, CC, and allele composition between hosts, such that 65% of isolates could be attributed to a known host. These results suggest that cattle and sheep within the spatiotemporal scales analyzed are each capable of contributing homogeneous Campylobacter strains to human infections.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Bacterial species comprise related genotypes that can display divergent phenotypes with important clinical implications. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common cause of nosocomial infections and, critical to its pathogenesis, is its ability to adhere and form biofilms on surfaces, thereby moderating the effect of the host’s immune response and antibiotics. Commensal S. epidermidis populations are thought to differ from those associated with disease in factors involved in adhesion and biofilm accumulation. We quantified the differences in biofilm formation in 98 S. epidermidis isolates from various sources, and investigated population structure based on ribosomal multilocus typing (rMLST) and the presence/absence of genes involved in adhesion and biofilm formation. All isolates were able to adhere and form biofilms in in vitro growth assays and confocal microscopy allowed classification into 5 biofilm morphotypes based on their thickness, biovolume and roughness. Phylogenetic reconstruction grouped isolates into three separate clades, with the isolates in the main disease associated clade displaying diversity in morphotype. Of the biofilm morphology characteristics, only biofilm thickness had a significant association with clade distribution. The distribution of some known adhesion-associated genes (aap and sesE) among isolates showed a significant association with the species clonal frame. These data challenge the assumption that biofilm-associated genes, such as those on the ica operon, are genetic markers for less invasive S. epidermidis isolates, and suggest that phenotypic characteristics, such as adhesion and biofilm formation, are not fixed by clonal descent but are influenced by the presence of various genes that are mobile among lineages.",

        "abstract": "The genus Neisseria contains two important yet very different pathogens, N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae, in addition to non-pathogenic species, of which N. lactamica is the best characterized. Genomic comparisons of these three bacteria will provide insights into the mechanisms and evolution of pathogenesis in this group of organisms, which are applicable to understanding these processes more generally. Non-pathogenic N. lactamica exhibits very similar population structure and levels of diversity to the meningococcus, whilst gonococci are essentially recent descendents of a single clone. All three species share a common core gene set estimated to comprise around 1190 CDSs, corresponding to about 60% of the genome. However, some of the nucleotide sequence diversity within this core genome is particular to each group, indicating that cross-species recombination is rare in this shared core gene set. Other than the meningococcal cps region, which encodes the polysaccharide capsule, relatively few members of the large accessory gene pool are exclusive to one species group, and cross-species recombination within this accessory genome is frequent. The three Neisseria species groups represent coherent biological and genetic groupings which appear to be maintained by low rates of inter-species horizontal genetic exchange within the core genome. There is extensive evidence for exchange among positively selected genes and the accessory genome and some evidence of hitch-hiking of housekeeping genes with other loci. It is not possible to define a ‘pathogenome’ for this group of organisms and the disease causing phenotypes are therefore likely to be complex, polygenic, and different among the various disease-associated phenotypes observed.",

        "abstract": "Identification of antigenic variants of the PorA protein of Neisseria meningitidis with specific mAbs (serosubtyping) is used in meningococcal strain characterization and the resultant data has been exploited in the design of novel multivalent vaccines against this important pathogen. The reactivity of the P1.10 serosubtyping mAb MN20F4.17 with eight members of the meningococcal P1.10 variable region (VR) family (prototype P1.10 and variants P1.10a-P1.10g), identified by nucleotide sequence analysis of porA genes, was investigated. Analysis of overlapping synthetic octapeptides by ELISA demonstrated that the peptide sequence, QNQRPTL, present only in the prototype P1.10, was sufficient for binding of the mAb. A linear peptide of 14 amino acids, containing the minimum epitope, inhibited binding of mAb MN20F4.17 to whole cells in a competitive ELISA. This binding was weak compared with a tethered peptide or the native protein. In whole-cell ELISA or dot-blot assays using low concentrations of mAb MN20F4.17 only the prototype P1.10 was detected. However, when higher concentrations of antibody were used the prototype P1.10 was detected, together with variants P1.10a, P1.10c and P1.10e by whole-cell ELISA and P1.10a and P1.10c by the immunoblot technique. The variants P1.10b, P1.10d, P1.10f and P1.10g showed no reactivity with mAb under any of the conditions tested. A survey of the porA genes in serogroup B and C strains revealed that the P1.10a variant, rather than the prototype P1.10, was the most common member of the P1.10 VR family in England and Wales. These data illustrate: (i) the problems associated with epidemiological analyses that rely solely on monoclonal antibodies; (ii) the importance of using defined assay conditions for serosubtyping; and (iii) that genetical analyses provide more reliable information than serological data based on murine reagents for the design of candidate vaccines that include PorA.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Understanding the structure of a bacterial population is essential in order to understand bacterial evolution. Estimating the core genome (those genes common to all, or nearly all, strains of a species) is a key component of such analyses. The size and composition of the core genome varies by dataset, but we hypothesized that the variation between different collections of the same bacterial species would be minimal. To investigate this, we analyzed the genome sequences of 3,118 pneumococci recovered from healthy individuals in Reykjavik (Iceland), Southampton (United Kingdom), Boston (United States), and Maela (Thailand). The analyses revealed a “supercore” genome (genes shared by all 3,118 pneumococci) of 558 genes, although an additional 354 core genes were shared by pneumococci from Reykjavik, Southampton, and Boston. Overall, the size and composition of the core and pan-genomes among pneumococci recovered in Reykjavik, Southampton, and Boston were similar. Maela pneumococci were distinctly different in that they had a smaller core genome and larger pan-genome. The pan-genome of Maela pneumococci contained several >25 Kb sequence regions (flanked by pneumococcal genes) that were homologous to genomic regions found in other bacterial species. Overall, our work revealed that some subsets of the global pneumococcal population are highly heterogeneous, and our hypothesis was rejected. This is an important finding in terms of understanding genetic variation among pneumococci and is also an essential point of consideration before generalizing the findings from a single dataset to the wider pneumococcal population.",

        "abstract": "The relationship between carriage and the development of invasive meningococcal disease is not fully understood. We investigated the changes in meningococcal carriage in 892 military recruits in Finland during a nonepidemic period (July 2004 to January 2006) and characterized all of the oropharyngeal meningococcal isolates obtained (n = 215) by using phenotypic (serogrouping and serotyping) and genotypic (porA typing and multilocus sequence typing) methods. For comparison, 84 invasive meningococcal disease strains isolated in Finland between January 2004 and February 2006 were also analyzed. The rate of meningococcal carriage was significantly higher at the end of military service than on arrival (18% versus 2.2%; P < 0.001). Seventy-four percent of serogroupable carriage isolates belonged to serogroup B, and 24% belonged to serogroup Y. Most carriage isolates belonged to the carriage-associated ST-60 clonal complex. However, 21.5% belonged to the hyperinvasive ST-41/44 clonal complex. Isolates belonging to the ST-23 clonal complex were cultured more often from oropharyngeal samples taken during the acute phase of respiratory infection than from samples taken at health examinations at the beginning and end of military service (odds ratio [OR], 6.7; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.7 to 16.4). The ST-32 clonal complex was associated with meningococcal disease (OR, 17.8; 95% CI, 3.8 to 81.2), while the ST-60 clonal complex was associated with carriage (OR, 10.7; 95% CI, 3.3 to 35.2). These findings point to the importance of meningococcal vaccination for military recruits and also to the need for an efficacious vaccine against serogroup B isolates.",

The recent accumulation of nucleotide sequence data from multiple members of diverse bacterial genera has facilitated comparative studies that have revealed many features of this process. Here we focus on genetic exchange that has involved homologous recombination and illustrate how nucleotide sequence data have furthered our understanding of: (i) the frequency of recombination; (ii) the impact of recombination in different parts of the genome; and (iii) patterns of gene flow within bacterial populations. Summarizing the results obtained for a range of bacteria, we survey evidence indicating that the extent and nature of recombination vary widely among microbiological species and often among lineages assigned to the same microbiological species.

Molecular mechanisms involved in N. meningitidis capsule biosynthesis have also been identified, and genes involved in this process and in cell surface translocation are clustered at a single chromosomal locus termed cps. The use of multiple names for some of the genes involved in capsule synthesis, combined with the need for rapid diagnosis of serogroups commonly associated with invasive meningococcal disease, prompted a requirement for a consistent approach to the nomenclature of capsule genes. In this report, a comprehensive description of all N. meningitidis serogroups is provided, along with a proposed nomenclature, which was presented at the 2012 XVIIIth International Pathogenic Neisseria Conference.",

The availability of multiple whole genome sequences from Campylobacter isolates presents the prospect of identifying those genes or allelic variants responsible for host-association and increased human disease risk, but the diversity of Campylobacter genomes present challenges for such analyses.

Using a population-based approach that analyzes multiple loci around the chromosome, we demonstrate that neutral genetic variation in genes associated with antimicrobial drug resistance has sufficient variation to construct a robust phylogenetic tree for M. tuberculosis. The data describe a clonal population with a minimum of four distinct M. tuberculosis lineages, closely related to M. bovis. The lineages are strongly geographically associated. Nucleotide substitutions proven to cause drug resistance are distributed throughout the tree, whereas nonsynonymous base substitutions unrelated to drug resistance have a restricted distribution. The phylogenetic structure is concordant with all the previously described genotypic and phenotypic groupings of M. tuberculosis strains and provides a unifying framework for both epidemiologic and evolutionary analysis of M. tuberculosis populations.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is a worldwide health issue that is potentially preventable with vaccination. In view of its sporadic nature and the high diversity of Neisseria meningitidis, epidemiological surveillance incorporating detailed isolate characterisation is crucial for effective control and understanding the evolving epidemiology of IMD. The Meningitis Research Foundation Meningococcus Genome Library (MRF-MGL) exploits whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for this purpose and presents data on a comprehensive and coherent IMD isolate collection from England and Wales via the internet. We assessed the contribution of these data to investigating IMD epidemiology. WGS data were obtained for all 899 IMD isolates available for England and Wales in epidemiological years 2010–11 and 2011–12. The data had been annotated at 1720 loci, analysed, and disseminated online. Information was also available on meningococcal population structure and vaccine (Bexsero, GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, Middlesex, UK) antigen variants, which enabled the investigation of IMD-associated genotypes over time and by patients' age groups. Population genomic analyses were done with a hierarchical gene-by-gene approach. The methods used by MRF-MGL efficiently characterised IMD isolates and information was provided in plain language. At least 20 meningococcal lineages were identified, three of which (hyperinvasive clonal complexes 41/44 [lineage 3], 269 [lineage 2], and 23 [lineage 23]) were responsible for 528 (59%) of IMD isolates. Lineages were highly diverse and showed evidence of extensive recombination. Specific lineages were associated with IMD in particular age groups, with notable diversity in the youngest and oldest individuals. The increased incidence of IMD from 1984 to 2010 in England and Wales was due to successive and concurrent epidemics of different lineages. Genetically, 74% of isolates were characterised as encoding group B capsules: 16% group Y, 6% group W, and 3% group C. Exact peptide matches for individual Bexsero vaccine antigens were present in up to 26% of isolates. Meningitis Research Foundation, Wellcome Trust, Public Health England, European Union.",

This paper investigates the influence of NPNs on the epidemiology of meningococcal infection. Neisseria isolates were collected during 18 surveys conducted in six countries in the African meningitis belt between 2010 and 2012 and characterized at the rplF locus to determine species and at the variable region of the fetA antigen gene. Prevalence and risk factors for carriage were analyzed. A total of 4694 isolates of Neisseria were obtained from 46,034 pharyngeal swabs, a carriage prevalence of 10.2% (95% CI, 9.8–10.5). Five Neisseria species were identified, the most prevalent NPN being Neisseria lactamica. Six hundred and thirty-six combinations of rplF/fetA_VR alleles were identified, each defined as a Neisseria strain type. There was an inverse relationship between carriage of N. meningitidis and of NPNs by age group, gender and season, whereas carriage of both N. meningitidis and NPNs was negatively associated with a recent history of meningococcal vaccination. Variations in the prevalence of NPNs by time, place and genetic type may contribute to the particular epidemiology of meningococcal disease in the African meningitis belt.",

To address this problem, and to aid non-culture diagnosis, a semi-nested PCR protocol for the amplification of the meningococcal porB gene from clinical specimens was developed. This gene encodes the meningococcal serotyping antigen; strain typing data was provided by hybridization of allele-specific oligonucleotide probes to the digoxigenin-labelled porB amplicon in a ‘PCR ELISA’. This assay was specific for meningococcal DNA and sensitivities of 0·81 for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 0·57 for serum, and 0·62 for whole blood taken from patients with proven meningococcal infection were obtained.",

Compared to standard crates, counts of bacteria, including Campylobacter, were consistently lower on silver ion containing crates throughout the decontamination process. In total, 16 different sequence types were identified from 89 Campylobacter jejuni isolates from crates. These were attributed to putative source population (chicken, cattle, sheep, the environment, wild bird) using the population genetic model, structure. Most (89%) were attributed to chicken, with 22% attribution to live chicken and 78% to retail poultry meat. MLST revealed a progressive shift in allele frequencies through the crate decontamination process. Campylobacter on crates survived for at least 3 h after sanitization, a period of time equivalent to the journey from the processing plant to the majority of farms in the catchment, showing the potential for involvement of crates in transmission.

        "abstract": "Neisseria meningitidis, the meningococcus, is normally a harmless commensal bacterium that colonises the naso/oropharynx of humans. This antigenically variable gram-negative diplococcus has the potential, however, to cause rapidly progressing meningitis and fulminant septicemia, either separately or together (1,2). Once present in the bloodstream, meningococci grow rapidly and their highly toxic lipo-oligosaccharides frequently cause extensive tissue damage and severe toxic shock. The progress of the disease is swift, and death often occurs within hours of the onset of symptoms (3). Even in countries where meningococcal infection is relatively rare, it remains a high priority for public health services because of the high mortality rates of fulminant septicemic disease (which can be up to 40% even when intensive supportive therapy is available), the high proportion of sequelae in patients who have recovered (including brain damage and digit or limb loss), and the age groups most susceptible (young children and, to a lesser extent, teenagers)",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Neisseria meningitidis expresses type four pili (Tfp) which are important for colonisation and virulence. Tfp have been considered as one of the most variable structures on the bacterial surface due to high frequency gene conversion, resulting in amino acid sequence variation of the major pilin subunit (PilE). Meningococci express either a class I or a class II pilE gene and recent work has indicated that class II pilins do not undergo antigenic variation, as class II pilE genes encode conserved pilin subunits. The purpose of this work was to use whole genome sequences to further investigate the frequency and variability of the class II pilE genes in meningococcal isolate collections. We analysed over 600 publically available whole genome sequences of N. meningitidis isolates to determine the sequence and genomic organization of pilE. We confirmed that meningococcal strains belonging to a limited number of clonal complexes (ccs, namely cc1, cc5, cc8, cc11 and cc174) harbour a class II pilE gene which is conserved in terms of sequence and chromosomal context. We also identified pilS cassettes in all isolates with class II pilE, however, our analysis indicates that these do not serve as donor sequences for pilE/pilS recombination. Furthermore, our work reveals that the class II pilE locus lacks the DNA sequence motifs that enable (G4) or enhance (Sma/Cla repeat) pilin antigenic variation. Finally, through analysis of pilin genes in commensal Neisseria species we found that meningococcal class II pilE genes are closely related to pilE from Neisseria lactamica and Neisseria polysaccharea, suggesting horizontal transfer among these species. Class II pilins can be defined by their amino acid sequence and genomic context and are present in meningococcal isolates which have persisted and spread globally. The absence of G4 and Sma/Cla sequences adjacent to the class II pilE genes is consistent with the lack of pilin subunit variation in these isolates, although horizontal transfer may generate class II pilin diversity. This study supports the suggestion that high frequency antigenic variation of pilin is not universal in pathogenic Neisseria.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Study of meningococcal carriage is essential to understanding the epidemiology of Neisseria meningitidis infection. Twenty cross-sectional carriage surveys were conducted in 7 countries in the African meningitis belt; 5 surveys were conducted after introduction of a new serogroup A meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenAfriVac). Pharyngeal swab specimens were collected, and Neisseria species were identified by microbiological and molecular techniques. A total of 1687 of 48 490 participants (3.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.2%–3.6%) carried meningococci. Carriage was more frequent in individuals aged 5–14 years, relative to those aged 15–29 years (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.41; 95% CI, 1.25–1.60); in males, relative to females (adjusted OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.10–1.24); in individuals in rural areas, relative to those in urban areas (adjusted OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.28–1.63); and in the dry season, relative to the rainy season (adjusted OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.37–1.75). Forty-eight percent of isolates had genes encoding disease-associated polysaccharide capsules; genogroup W predominated, and genogroup A was rare. Strain diversity was lower in countries in the center of the meningitis belt than in Senegal or Ethiopia. The prevalence of genogroup A fell from 0.7% to 0.02% in Chad following mass vaccination with MenAfriVac. The prevalence of meningococcal carriage in the African meningitis belt is lower than in industrialized countries and is very diverse and dynamic, even in the absence of vaccination.",

        "abstract": "The nature of species boundaries in bacteria remains controversial. In particular, the mechanisms of bacterial speciation and maintenance in the face of frequent genetic exchange are poorly understood. Here, we report patterns of genetic exchange that show two closely related zoonotic pathogenic species, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, are converging as a consequence of recent changes in gene flow. Population expansion into a novel ecological niche generated by human activity is the most probable explanation for the increase in genetic exchange between these species. Bacterial speciation can therefore occur by mechanisms analogous to those seen in metazoans, where genetic diversification and incipient speciation caused by ecological factors have been reported in several genera.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "An intensive study of 443 isolates of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli from 2031 fecal samples excreted by animal sources including cattle, sheep, and pigs, a range of wild and domesticated avian species and pets is described. The prevalence found in the majority of animal sources ranged from 22% to 28% with poultry being highest at 41% and cats and dogs lowest (<5%). The average count excreted for each animal source was found not to be significantly different ranging from approximately 102 to 105 cfu/g. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) identified phylogenies that exhibited host specificity. A number of clonal complexes (CCs) and sequence types (STs) were characteristic of particular hosts (e.g., CC-179, ST-637, and ST-1341 found only in pigeons and gulls). Analysis of genetic distance demonstrated numerous significant differences in the distribution of MLST types (CC, ST, and allele) between animal sources. Host association was quantified using structure that correctly assigned the nine animal sources with accuracies of 28%, 24%, and 55% at the CC, ST, and allele levels, respectively. This is substantially higher than would be expected by random allocation (11%) but farmyard poultry had the lowest assignment accuracy (13%, 13%, and 21%) suggesting that isolates were shared with a wide range of other animals. This study demonstrates the link between MLST type and host and provides data that can be used in risk assessment and food attribution models. Further, it demonstrates the applicability of MLST to characterize Campylobacter strains from a broad range of environmental sources.",

        "abstract": "Live attenuated vaccines, developed with molecular genetical techniques, require new approaches for their quality control. To develop novel quality control tests that enhanced and extended existing procedures, the attenuated vaccine strain Salmonella typhi Ty21a and its parent strain Ty2 were characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and direct nucleotide sequence analysis. Mutant and parent strains were distinguished using fingerprints generated by the resolution on PFGE of chromosomal DNA digested with each of the enzymes Sfil, Spel or Xbal. These fingerprints were stable through multiple in vitro passages of the vaccine strain and were identical from one batch of vaccine to another. It was also possible to distinguish between the mutant and parent strains by direct nucleotide sequence analysis of the galE gene. This analysis identified two base changes in the gene from strain Ty21a: a single base deletion causing a frameshift that would result in a truncated gene product, accounting for the galE phenotype; and a transition that eliminated an Alul restriction site. The consequent change in the Alul fingerprint of the galE gene in strain Ty21a provided a rapid, PCR-based alternative to the use of differential media or biochemical assays for the identification of the vaccine strain.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "No single genealogical reconstruction or typing method currently encompasses all levels of bacterial diversity, from domain to strain. We propose ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST), an approach which indexes variation of the 53 genes encoding the bacterial ribosome protein subunits (rps genes), as a means of integrating microbial genealogy and typing. As with multilocus sequence typing (MLST), rMLST employs curated reference sequences to identify gene variants efficiently and rapidly. The rps loci are ideal targets for a universal characterization scheme as they are: (i) present in all bacteria; (ii) distributed around the chromosome; and (iii) encode proteins which are under stabilizing selection for functional conservation. Collectively, the rps loci exhibit variation that resolves bacteria into groups at all taxonomic and most typing levels, providing significantly more resolution than 16S small subunit rRNA gene phylogenies. A web-accessible expandable database, comprising whole-genome data from more than 1900 bacterial isolates, including 28 draft genomes assembled de novo from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) sequence read archive, has been assembled. The rps gene variation catalogued in this database permits rapid and computationally non-intensive identification of the phylogenetic position of any bacterial sequence at the domain, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species and strain levels. The groupings generated with rMLST data are consistent with current nomenclature schemes and independent of the clustering algorithm used. This approach is applicable to the other domains of life, potentially providing a rational and universal approach to the classification of life that is based on one of its fundamental features, the translation mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Chlamydia comprises a group of obligate intracellular bacterial parasites responsible for a variety of diseases in humans and animals, including several zoonoses. Chlamydia trachomatis causes diseases such as trachoma, urogenital infection and lymphogranuloma venereum with severe morbidity. Chlamydia pneumoniae is a common cause of community-acquired respiratory tract infections. Chlamydia psittaci, causing zoonotic pneumonia in humans, is usually hosted by birds, while Chlamydia abortus, causing abortion and fetal death in mammals, including humans, is mainly hosted by goats and sheep. We used multi-locus sequence typing to asses the population structure of Chlamydia. In total, 132 Chlamydia isolates were analyzed, including 60 C. trachomatis, 18 C. pneumoniae, 16 C. abortus, 34 C. psittaci and one of each of C. pecorum, C. caviae, C. muridarum and C. felis. Cluster analyses utilizing the Neighbour-Joining algorithm with the maximum composite likelihood model of concatenated sequences of 7 housekeeping fragments showed that C. psittaci 84/2334 isolated from a parrot grouped together with the C. abortus isolates from goats and sheep. Cluster analyses of the individual alleles showed that in all instances C. psittaci 84/2334 formed one group with C. abortus. Moving 84/2334 from the C. psittaci group to the C. abortus group resulted in a significant increase in the number of fixed differences and elimination of the number of shared mutations between C. psittaci and C. abortus. C. psittaci M56 from a muskrat branched separately from the main group of C. psittaci isolates. C. psittaci genotypes appeared to be associated with host species. The phylogenetic tree of C. psittaci did not follow that of its host bird species, suggesting host species jumps. In conclusion, we report for the first time an association between C. psittaci genotypes with host species.",

In addition to providing a standardized approach to data collection, by examining the nucleotide sequences of multiple loci encoding housekeeping genes, or fragments of them, MLST data are made freely available over the Internet to ensure that a uniform nomenclature is readily available to all those interested in categorizing bacteria. At the time of writing, over thirty MLST schemes have been published and made available on the Internet, mostly for pathogenic bacteria, although there are schemes for pathogenic fungi and some nonpathogenic bacteria. MLST data have been employed in epidemiological investigations of various scales and in studies of the population biology, pathogenicity, and evolution of bacteria. The increasing speed and reduced cost of nucleotide sequence determination, together with improved web-based databases and analysis tools, present the prospect of increasingly wide application of MLST.",

        "abstract": "Adhesion between the opacity-associated adhesin (Opa) proteins of Neisseria meningitidis and human carcino-embryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) proteins is an important stage in the pathogenesis of meningococcal disease, a globally important bacterial infection. Most disease is caused by a small number of meningococcal genotypes known as hyperinvasive lineages. As these are also carried asymptomatically, acquisition of them alone cannot explain why only some hosts develop meningococcal disease. Our aim was to determine whether genetic diversity in CEACAM is associated with susceptibility to meningococcal disease. Frequency distributions of alleles, genotypes and haplotypes were compared in four CEACAM genes in 384 case samples and 190 controls. Linkage disequilibrium among polymorphic sites, haplotype structures and relationships were also analysed. A number of polymorphisms were observed in CEACAM genes but the diversity of CEACAM1, to which most Opa proteins bind, was lower, and a small number of high-frequency haplotypes were detected. Dose-dependent associations of three CEACAM haplotypes with meningococcal disease were observed, with the effect of carrying these haplotypes amplified in homozygous individuals. Two haplotypes were protective while one haplotype in CEACAM6 was associated with a twofold increase in disease susceptibility. These data imply that human CEACAM may be one determinant of human susceptibility to meningococcal disease.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "A framework of general factors for infectious disease emergence was made operational for Campylobacter utilising explanatory variables including time series and risk factor data. These variables were generated using a combination of empirical epidemiology, case-case and case-control studies, time series analysis, and microbial sub-typing (source attribution, diversity, genetic distance) to unravel the changing/emerging aetiology of human campylobacteriosis. The study focused on Scotland between 1990–2012 where there was a 75% increase in reported cases that included >300% increase in the elderly and 50% decrease in young children. During this period there were three phases 1990–2000 a 75% rise and a 20% fall to 2006, followed by a 19% resurgence. The rise coincided with expansions in the poultry industry, consumption of chicken, and a shift from rural to urban cases. The post-2000 fall occurred across all groups apart from the elderly and coincided with a drop of the prevalence of Campylobacter in chicken and a higher proportion of rural cases. The increase in the elderly was associated with uptake of proton pump inhibitors. During the resurgence the increase was predominantly in adults and the elderly, again there was increasing use of PPIs and high prevalences in chicken and ruminants. Cases associated with foreign travel during the study also increased from 9% to a peak of 16% in 2006 before falling to an estimated 10% in 2011, predominantly in adults and older children. During all three periods source attribution, genetic distance, and diversity measurements placed human isolates most similar to those in chickens. A combination of emergence factors generic for infectious diseases were responsible for the Campylobacter epidemic. It was possible to use these to obtain a putative explanation for the changes in human disease and the potential to make an informed view of how incidence rates may change in the future.",

        "abstract": "Previously we have shown that insertion of IS1301 in the sia/ctr intergenic region (IGR) of serogroup C Neisseria meningitidis (MenC) isolates from Spain confers increased resistance against complement-mediated killing. Here we investigate the significance of IS1301 in the same location in N. meningitidis isolates from the UK. PCR and sequencing was used to screen a collection of more than 1500 meningococcal carriage and disease isolates from the UK for the presence of IS1301 in the IGR. IS1301 was not identified in the IGR among vaccine failure strains but was frequently found in serogroup B isolates (MenB) from clonal complex 269 (cc269). Almost all IS1301 insertions in cc269 were associated with novel polymorphisms, and did not change capsule expression or resistance to human complement. After excluding sequence types (STs) distant from the central genotype within cc269, there was no significant difference for the presence of IS1301 in the IGR of carriage isolates compared to disease isolates. Isolates with insertion of IS1301 in the IGR are not responsible for MenC disease in UK vaccine failures. Novel polymorphisms associated with IS1301 in the IGR of UK MenB isolates do not lead to the resistance phenotype seen for IS1301 in the IGR of MenC isolates.",

        "abstract": "A combination of data obtained by classical epidemiological techniques with insights gained from the analysis of the population biology of Neisseria meningitidis have proved to be critical in understanding the spread of menin-gococcal disease. This is a consequence of the natural history and evolution of this bacterium, which, despite its fearsome reputation as an aggressive pathogen (1), is ordinarily a harmless commensal inhabitant of the nasopharynx of adult humans (2). Further, it has been established that “natural,” (that is to say, carried) populations of meningococci are highly diverse, with a minority of genotypes (the “hyperinvasive lineages”) being responsible for the majority of disease (3). Finally, it is known that distinct hyperinvasive lineages tend to be associated with particular epidemiological manifestations of meningococcal disease (4) and some are especially associated with severe disease (the “hyper-virulent” lineages) (5). These complexities have important implications for public-health interventions, as different disease epidemiologies, caused by genetically diverse meningococci, require distinct approaches to public-health management. For example, the public-health response necessary to combat large-scale meningococcal-disease outbreaks in Africa (6) is different from that required during an institutional disease outbreak in Europe and North America, and prolonged geographical outbreaks in these countries require a different response again (7). In recognition of the importance of the multi-disciplinary approach necessary to establish these insights, this section contains chapters ranging from outbreak management through surveillance and isolate characterization techniques to phylogenetic methods. Together the chapters provide the methodologies necessary for monitoring, understanding, and reacting to the spread of meningococcal disease.",

A representative European Meningococcal Strain Collection (EMSC) of IMD isolates was obtained, and whole genome sequenced to characterise 799 EMSC isolates from the epidemiological year July 2011–June 2012. To establish a genome library (GL), the isolate information was deposited in the pubMLST.org/neisseria database. Genomes were curated and annotated at 2,429 meningococcal loci, including those defining clonal complex, capsule, antigens, and antimicrobial resistance. Most genomes contained genes encoding B (n = 525; 65.7%) or C (n = 163; 20.4%) capsules; isolates were genetically highly diverse, with >20 genomic lineages, five of which comprising 60.7% (n = 485) of isolates. There were >350 antigenic fine-types: 307 were present once, the most frequent (P1.7-2,4:F5-1) comprised 8% (n = 64) of isolates. Each genome was characterised for Bexsero Antigen Sequence Typing (BAST): 25.5% (n = 204) of isolates contained alleles encoding the fHbp and/or the PorA VR1 vaccine component, but most genomes (n = 513; 64.2%) did not contain the NadA component. EMSC-GL will support an integrated surveillance of disease-associated genotypes in Europe, enabling the monitoring of hyperinvasive lineages, outbreak identification, and supporting vaccine programme implementation.",

We identified 379 combinations of the MLST loci (sequence types) and 215 combinations of the cell-surface components among these isolates, which had been obtained from human disease, animals, food, and the environment. Despite this diversity, 748 (92%) of the isolates belonged to one of 17 clonal complexes, 6 of which contained many (318, 63%) of the human disease isolates. Several clonal complexes exhibited associations with isolation source or particular cell-surface components; however, the latter were poorly predictive of clonal complex.

        "abstract": "Intramammary infection with Streptococcus uberis is a common cause of bovine mastitis throughout the world. Several procedures to differentiate S. uberis isolates have been proposed. However, all are prone to interlaboratory variation, and none is suitable for the description of the population structure. We describe here the development of a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for S. uberis to help address these issues. The sequences of seven housekeeping gene fragments from each of 160 United Kingdom milk isolates of S. uberis were determined. Between 5 and 17 alleles were obtained per locus, giving the potential to discriminate between 1.3 × 107 sequence types. In this study, 57 sequence types (STs) were identified. Statistical comparisons between the maximum-likelihood trees constructed by using the seven housekeeping gene fragments showed that the congruence was no better than that between each tree and trees of random topology, indicating there had been significant recombination within these loci. The population contained one major lineage (designated the ST-5 complex). This dominated the population, containing 24 STs and representing 112 isolates. The other 33 STs were not assigned to any clonal complex. All of the isolates in the ST-5 lineage carried hasA, a gene that is essential for capsule production. There was no clear association between ST or clonal complex and disease. The S. uberis MLST system offers researchers a valuable tool that allows further investigation of the population biology of this organism and insights into the epidemiology of this disease on a global scale.",

Clinical laboratories are now using WGS for pathogen identification, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and epidemiological typing. WGS data also represent a valuable resource for the development and evaluation of molecular diagnostic assays, which continue to play an important role in clinical microbiology. To demonstrate this application of WGS, this study used publicly available genomic data to evaluate a duplex real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay that targets mapA and ceuE for the detection of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, leading global causes of bacterial gastroenteritis. In silico analyses of mapA and ceuE primer and probe sequences from 1,713 genetically diverse C. jejuni and C. coli genomes, supported by RT-PCR testing, indicated that the assay was robust, with 1,707 (99.7%) isolates correctly identified. The high specificity of the mapA-ceuE assay was the result of interspecies diversity and intraspecies conservation of the target genes in C. jejuni and C. coli. Rare instances of a lack of specificity among C. coli isolates were due to introgression in mapA or sequence diversity in ceuE. The results of this study illustrate how WGS can be exploited to evaluate molecular diagnostic assays by using publicly available data, online databases, and open-source software.",

The bacterium Campylobacter jejuni is a widespread zoonotic multihost pathogen, which frequently causes gastroenteritis in humans. Poultry products are important transmission vehicles to humans, but the bacterium is common in other domestic and wild animals, particularly birds, which are a potential infection source. Population genetic studies of C. jejuni have mainly investigated isolates from humans and domestic animals, so to assess C. jejuni population structure more broadly and investigate host adaptation, 928 wild bird isolates from Europe and Australia were genotyped by multilocus sequencing and compared to the genotypes recovered from 1366 domestic animal and human isolates. Campylobacter jejuni populations from different wild bird species were distinct from each other and from those from domestic animals and humans, and the host species of wild bird was the major determinant of C. jejuni genotype, while geographic origin was of little importance. By comparison, C. jejuni differentiation was restricted between more phylogenetically diverse farm animals, indicating that domesticated animals may represent a novel niche for C. jejuni and thereby driving the evolution of those bacteria as they exploit this niche. Human disease is dominated by isolates from this novel domesticated animal niche.",

        "abstract": "Campylobacter species cause a high proportion of bacterial gastroenteritis cases and are a significant burden on health care systems and economies worldwide; however, the relative contributions of the various possible sources of infection in humans are unclear. National-scale genotyping of Campylobacter species was used to quantify the relative importance of various possible sources of human infection. Multilocus sequence types were determined for 5674 isolates obtained from cases of human campylobacteriosis in Scotland from July 2005 through September 2006 and from 999 Campylobacter species isolates from 3417 contemporaneous samples from potential human infection sources. These data were supplemented with 2420 sequence types from other studies, representing isolates from a variety of sources. The clinical isolates were attributed to possible sources on the basis of their sequence types with use of 2 population genetic models, STRUCTURE and an asymmetric island model. The STRUCTURE and the asymmetric island models attributed most clinical isolates to chicken meat (58% and 78% of Campylobacter jejuni and 40% and 56% of Campylobacter coli isolates, respectively), identifying it as the principal source of Campylobacter infection in humans. Both models attributed the majority of the remaining isolates to ruminant sources, with relatively few isolates attributed to wild bird, environment, swine, and turkey sources. National-scale genotyping was a practical and efficient methodology for the quantification of the contributions of different sources to human Campylobacter infection. Combined with the knowledge that retail chicken is routinely contaminated with Campylobacter, these results are consistent with the view that the largest reductions in human campylobacteriosis in industrialized countries will come from interventions that focus on the poultry industry.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Closely related bacterial isolates can display divergent phenotypes. This can limit the usefulness of phylogenetic studies for understanding bacterial ecology and evolution. Here, we compare phenotyping based on Raman spectrometric analysis of cellular composition to phylogenetic classification by ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST) in 108 isolates of the zoonotic pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli. Automatic relevance determination (ARD) was used to identify informative peaks in the Raman spectra that could be used to distinguish strains in taxonomic and host source groups (species, clade, clonal complex, and isolate source/host). Phenotypic characterization based on Raman spectra showed a degree of agreement with genotypic classification using rMLST, with segregation accuracy between species (83.95%), clade (in C. coli, 98.41%), and, to some extent, clonal complex (86.89% C. jejuni ST-21 and ST-45 complexes) being achieved. This confirmed the utility of Raman spectroscopy for lineage classification and the correlation between genotypic and phenotypic classification. In parallel analysis, relatively distantly related isolates (different clonal complexes) were assigned the correct host origin irrespective of the clonal origin (74.07 to 96.97% accuracy) based upon different Raman peaks. This suggests that the phenotypic characteristics, from which the phenotypic signal is derived, are not fixed by clonal descent but are influenced by the host environment and change as strains move between hosts.",

        "abstract": "Primers suitable for the amplification of the gene encoding the class 1 outer membrane protein of Neisseria meningitidis by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were designed from published DNA sequences and used to study the gene in eight meningococcal strains of different serogroup, serotype and subtype. At high annealing stringency one product, shown to correspond to the class 1 protein gene, was amplified from each strain. For three strains an additional smaller product, provisionally identified as the gene encoding the class 3 outer membrane protein, was amplified at lower annealing stringencies. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the PCR products corresponding to the class 1 proteins established the differences in the primary structure of the proteins between each of the subtypes and other outer‐membrane proteins from Neisseria spp. These differences impose constraints on possible structural models of these proteins. Most amino acid sequence variation occurred in two domains of between 8 and 17 amino acids; there was an additional region which varied mainly between classes of outer membrane protein and there were nine conserved regions. Using appropriate primers it was possible to distinguish between class 1 outer membrane protein genes from strains of different subtypes by the PCR.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Neisseria meningitidis is a frequent colonizer of the human nasopharynx, with asymptomatic carriage providing the reservoir for invasive, disease-causing strains. Serogroup Y (MenY) strains are a major cause of meningococcal disease. High-resolution genetic analyses of carriage and disease isolates can establish epidemiological relationships and identify potential virulence factors. Whole-genome sequence data were obtained for 99 MenY carriage isolates recovered in the United Kingdom during 1997–2010. Sequences were compared to those of 73 MenY invasive isolates recovered during 2010–2011, using a gene-by-gene approach. Comparisons across 1605 core genes resolved 91% of isolates into one of 8 clusters containing closely related disease and carriage isolates. Six clusters contained carried meningococci isolated during 1997–2001, suggesting temporal stability. One cluster of isolates, predominately sharing the designation Y: P1.5-1,10-1: F4-1: ST-1655 (cc23), was resolved into one subcluster with 86% carriage isolates and a second with 90% invasive isolates. These subclusters were defined by specific allelic differences in 5 core genes encoding glycerate kinase (glxK), valine-pyruvate transaminase (avtA), superoxide dismutase (sodB), and 2 hypothetical proteins. High-resolution genetic analyses detected long-term temporal stability and temporally overlapping carriage and disease populations for MenY clones but also evidence of a disease-associated clone.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "In September, 2015, the meningococcal group B vaccine (Bexsero, GlaxoSmithKline) was introduced into the UK childhood immunisation schedule. Prelicensure coverage estimates used Meningococcal Antigen Typing System (MATS) to determine phenotype and function of circulating meningococci. Using whole-genome sequencing, we aimed to perform rapid, scalable, high-resolution analysis of peptide vaccine antigens in disease-causing meningococci before and after vaccine implementation. All culture-confirmed invasive meningococcal disease isolates from July 1, 2010, to June 30, 2016, from the UK underwent whole-genome sequencing (n=2994), representing 56·7% of cases reported to Public Health England. Genomes were hosted on the PubMLST database. The Bexsero Antigen Sequence Type (BAST) scheme was used to catalogue antigenic variants for comparison with the Bexsero type, BAST-1 (fHbp:1, NHBA:2, NadA:8, PorA VR1:7-2, PorA VR2:4). Statistical analysis was performed with R software (v3.2.4). Complete BASTs were obtained for 2915 isolates (97·4%). Within the fHbp family 1, variant 1 was only present in 105 (3·5%) of 2994 isolates. Variant 4 dominated since 2010–11 in BASTs 220, 226, and 229. From 2013–14 onwards, family 2 variants were more frequent than family 1 variants. NHBA variant 2 decreased from 373 (15·3%) of 2441 prevaccine isolates to 45 (9·4%) of 479 postvaccine isolates (p=0·001). The most common variant was 29 (557/2994). NadA was absent in 2049 (70·1%) of 2921 isolates. PorA VR2 had 106 variants, most frequently variants 2 (n=542), 9 (350), and 4 (333). Genotypic matches to BAST-1 (≥1 antigen) decreased from 30·4% (167/550) to 15·5% (83/536) over a 6 year period. Coverage including cross-reactive antigens was 60·2–69·0%. Genotype–phenotype modelling estimated coverage of 62·1% (95% CI 60·9–63·3), with no significant change before or after vaccine implementation. Recent clonal expansion of South American/UK serogroup W strain accounts for many antigenic changes, such as the increase in family 2 fHbp and NHBA variant 29. Cross-reactivity within the fHbp family 1 is a key determinant of vaccine immunogenicity. MATS coverage estimates of 73% (95% CI 57–87) were key to policy decisions for introduction of the vaccine in the UK. Analysis of recent disease isolates with genomic and genotype–phenotype correlations suggests that coverage estimates are lower but within the limits of previous MATS studies.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Phase variation (random ON/OFF switching) of gene expression is a common feature of host-adapted pathogenic bacteria. Phase variably expressed N6-adenine DNA methyltransferases (Mod) alter global methylation patterns resulting in changes in gene expression. These systems constitute phase variable regulons called phasevarions. Neisseria meningitidis phasevarions regulate genes including virulence factors and vaccine candidates, and alter phenotypes including antibiotic resistance. The target site recognized by these Type III N6-adenine DNA methyltransferases is not known. Single molecule, real-time (SMRT) methylome analysis was used to identify the recognition site for three key N. meningitidis methyltransferases: ModA11 (exemplified by M.NmeMC58I) (5′-CGYm6AG-3′), ModA12 (exemplified by M.Nme77I, M.Nme18I and M.Nme579II) (5′-ACm6ACC-3′) and ModD1 (exemplified by M.Nme579I) (5′-CCm6AGC-3′). Restriction inhibition assays and mutagenesis confirmed the SMRT methylome analysis. The ModA11 site is complex and atypical and is dependent on the type of pyrimidine at the central position, in combination with the bases flanking the core recognition sequence 5′-CGYm6AG-3′. The observed efficiency of methylation in the modA11 strain (MC58) genome ranged from 4.6% at 5′-GCGCm6AGG-3′ sites, to 100% at 5′-ACGTm6AGG-3′ sites. Analysis of the distribution of modified sites in the respective genomes shows many cases of association with intergenic regions of genes with altered expression due to phasevarion switching.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Herd protection, resulting from the interruption of transmission and asymptomatic carriage, is an important element of the effectiveness of vaccines against the meningococcus. Whilst this has been well established for conjugate polysaccharide vaccines directed against the meningococcal capsule, two uncertainties surround the potential herd protection provided by the novel protein-based vaccines that are used in place of serogroup B (MenB) polysaccharide vaccines (i) the strain coverage of such vaccines against carried meningococci, which are highly diverse; and (ii) the generation of a protective immune response in the mucosa. These considerations are essential for realistic estimates of cost-effectiveness of new MenB vaccines. Here the first of these questions is addressed by the whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis of meningococci isolated from healthy military recruits and university students in Greece. The study included a total of 71 MenB isolates obtained from 1420 oropharyngeal single swab samples collected from military recruits and university students on voluntary basis, aged 18–26 years. In addition to WGS analysis to identify genetic lineage and vaccine antigen genes, including the Bexsero Antigen Sequence Type (BAST), the isolates were examined with the serological Meningococcal antigen Typing System (MATS) assay. Comparison of these data demonstrated that the carried meningococcal population was highly diverse with 38% of the carriage isolates showed expression of antigens matching those included in the 4CMenB vaccine. Our data may suggest a limited potential herd immunity to be expected and be driven by an impact on a subset of carriage isolates.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "We typed 165 Candida albicans isolates from 44 different sources by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and ABC typing of rRNA genes and determined their homozygosity or heterozygosity at the mating-type-like locus (MTL). The isolates represented pairs or larger sets from individual sources, which allowed the determination of strain diversity within patients. A comparison of replicate sequence data determined a reproducibility threshold for regarding isolates as MLST indistinguishable. For 36 isolate sets, MLST and ABC typing showed indistinguishable or highly related strain types among isolates from different sites or from the same site at different times from each patient. This observation included 11 sets with at least one isolate from a blood culture and a nonsterile site from the same patient. For one patient, strain replacement was evidenced in the form of two sets of isolates from different hospital admissions where the strain types within each set were nearly identical but where the two sets differed both by MLST and ABC typing. MLST therefore confirms the existing view of C. albicans strain carriage. Microvariation, evidenced as small differences between MLST types, resulted in most instances from a loss of heterozygosity at one or more of the sequenced loci. Among isolate sets that showed major strain type differences, some isolates could be excluded as likely examples of handling errors during storage. However, for a minority of isolates, intermittent differences in ABC type for tightly clustered MLST types and intermittent appearances of MTL homozygosity lead us to propose that some C. albicans isolates, or all isolates under yet-to-be-determined conditions, maintain a high level of genetic diversity by mechanisms such as recombination, gene conversion, or chromosomal ploidy change.",

However, comparatively few studies have determined the epidemiological features of campylobacteriosis in resource-poor settings. A total of 1,941 faecal specimens collected from symptomatic (diarrhoeic) children and 507 specimens from asymptomatic (non-diarrhoeic) children hospitalised in Blantyre, Malawi, between 1997 and 2007, and previously tested for the presence of rotavirus and norovirus, was analysed for C. jejuni and C. coli using a real time PCR assay. Campylobacter species were detected in 415/1,941 (21%) of diarrhoeic children, with C. jejuni accounting for 85% of all cases. The median age of children with Campylobacter infection was 11 months (range 0.1–55 months), and was significantly higher than that for children with rotavirus and norovirus (6 months and 7 months respectively; P<0.001). Co-infection with either rotavirus or norovirus was noted in 41% of all cases in the diarrhoeic group. In contrast, the detection rate of Campylobacter in the non-diarrhoeic group was 14%, with viral co-infection identified in 16% of children with Campylobacter. There was no association between Campylobacter detection rate and season over the 10 year period. Using molecular detection methodology in hospitalised Malawian children, we have demonstrated a high prevalence of Campylobacter infection, with frequent viral co-infection. The burden of Campylobacter infection in young African children may be greater than previously recognised.",

The introduction of vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis into immunisation schedules, and particularly the conjugate polysaccharide vaccines which can interrupt transmission, raises the question of whether disease caused by this obligate human bacterium can be controlled, eliminated, or even eradicated. The limited number of meningococcal serogroups, lack of an animal reservoir, and importance of meningococcal disease are considerations in favour of eradication; however, the commensal nature of most infections, the high diversity of meningococcal populations, and the lack of comprehensive vaccines are all factors that suggest that this is not feasible. Indeed, any such attempt might be harmful by perturbing the human microbiome and its interaction with the immune system. On balance, the control and possible elimination of disease caused by particular disease-associated meningococcal genotypes is a more achievable and worthwhile goal.",

        "abstract": "Multi-country outbreaks of foodborne bacterial disease present challenges in their detection, tracking, and notification. As food is increasingly distributed across borders, such outbreaks are becoming more common. This increases the need for high-resolution, accessible, and replicable isolate typing schemes. Here we evaluate a core genome multilocus typing (cgMLST) scheme for the high-resolution reproducible typing of Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) isolates, by its application to a large European outbreak of S. enterica serovar Enteritidis. This outbreak had been extensively characterised using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based approaches. The cgMLST analysis was congruent with the original SNP-based analysis, the epidemiological data, and whole genome MLST (wgMLST) analysis. Combination of the cgMLST and epidemiological data confirmed that the genetic diversity among the isolates predated the outbreak, and was likely present at the infection source. There was consequently no link between country of isolation and genetic diversity, but the cgMLST clusters were congruent with date of isolation. Furthermore, comparison with publicly available Enteritidis isolate data demonstrated that the cgMLST scheme presented is highly scalable, enabling outbreaks to be contextualised within the Salmonella genus. The cgMLST scheme is therefore shown to be a standardised and scalable typing method, which allows Salmonella outbreaks to be analysed and compared across laboratories and jurisdictions.",

Phylogenetic analysis established that the allelic variants had been generated by both point mutation and horizontal genetic exchange. Nucleotide substitution was unevenly distributed in the gene, which contained both conserved and variable sequence regions. The most conserved region of the translated peptide sequence corresponded to an amino-terminal domain of the protein and the most diverse region to a previously identified variable region (VR). A nomenclature system for the peptides encoded by the VR was devised which classified 24 variants into 5 FetA variant families. On the basis of these data, murine polyclonal sera specific for four FetA variants were generated. The reactivities of these sera in whole-cell ELISA experiments were consistent with the hypothesis that the VR encoded an immunodominant epitope and indicated that the sera reacted mainly with variants against which they were raised. The diversity of this protein is likely to limit its effectiveness as a vaccine component.",

        "abstract": "Neisseria meningitis is a human commensal bacterium that occasionally causes life-threatening disease. As with a number of other bacterial pathogens, meningococcal populations comprise distinct lineages, which persist over many decades and during global spread in the face of high rates of recombination. In addition, the propensity to cause invasive disease is associated with particular “hyperinvasive” lineages that coexist with less invasive lineages despite the fact that disease does not contribute to host-to-host transmission. Here, by combining a modeling approach with molecular epidemiological data from 1,108 meningococci isolated in the Czech Republic over 27 years, we show that interstrain competition, mediated by immune selection, can explain both the persistence of multiple discrete meningococcal lineages and the association of a subset of these with invasive disease. The model indicates that the combinations of allelic variants of housekeeping genes that define these lineages are associated with very small differences in transmission efficiency among hosts. These findings have general implications for the emergence of lineage structure and virulence in recombining bacterial populations.",

        "abstract": "Some of the most common infectious diseases are caused by bacteria that naturally colonise humans asymptomatically. Combating these opportunistic pathogens requires an understanding of the traits that differentiate infecting strains from harmless relatives. Staphylococcus epidermidis is carried asymptomatically on the skin and mucous membranes of virtually all humans but is a major cause of nosocomial infection associated with invasive procedures. Here we address the underlying evolutionary mechanisms of opportunistic pathogenicity by combining pangenome-wide association studies and laboratory microbiology to compare S. epidermidis from bloodstream and wound infections and asymptomatic carriage. We identify 61 genes containing infection-associated genetic elements (k-mers) that correlate with in vitro variation in known pathogenicity traits (biofilm formation, cell toxicity, interleukin-8 production, methicillin resistance). Horizontal gene transfer spreads these elements, allowing divergent clones to cause infection. Finally, Random Forest model prediction of disease status (carriage vs. infection) identifies pathogenicity elements in 415 S. epidermidis isolates with 80% accuracy, demonstrating the potential for identifying risk genotypes pre-operatively.",

A survey of Campylobacter shedding of 957 wild starlings was undertaken by culture of faecal specimens and genetic analysis of the campylobacters isolated: shedding rates were 30.6% for Campylobacter jejuni, 0.6% for C. coli and 6.3% for C. lari. Genotyping by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and antigen sequence typing established that these bacteria were distinct from poultry or human disease isolates with the ST‐177 and ST‐682 clonal complexes possibly representing starling‐adapted genotypes. There was seasonal variation in both shedding rate and genotypic diversity, both exhibiting a maximum during the late spring/early summer. Host age also affected Campylobacter shedding, which was higher in younger birds, and turnover was rapid with no evidence of cross‐immunity among Campylobacter species or genotypes. In nestlings, C. jejuni shedding was evident from 9 days of age but siblings were not readily co‐infected. The dynamics of Campylobacter infection of starlings differed from that observed in commercial poultry and consequently there was no evidence that wild starlings represent a major source of Campylobacter infections of food animals or humans.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "The possibility of sexual reproduction in the human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans is a question of great interest in medical mycology. Not only is it a fundamental biological issue, but it is also a potential mechanism for contributing to the phenotypic plasticity (and hence the virulence) of the organism. Molecular genotyping methods such as multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) are generating data that can shed light on this question. In the present study we have used MLST information to generate haplotypes that identify many different homologues of a chromosome within a collection of strains. Particular combinations of these haplotypes provide evidence for chromosomal segregation and intra-chromosome recombination. All of our observations of haplotype diversity could also be explained by other mechanisms, such as gene conversion or mitotic recombination, and the resolution of these issues will require a denser map of accurately localised markers. A common event observed in strain evolution is loss of heterozygosity at a particular marker. Our results contribute to the emerging picture of C. albicans as an organism whose primary means of reproduction is clonal, but with a small but important contribution from sexual reproduction, occurring in nature but not under commonly used laboratory conditions.",

        "abstract": "Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of meningitis and septicaemia. The hyperinvasive ST-11 clonal complex (cc11) caused serogroup C (MenC) outbreaks in the US military in the 1960s and UK universities in the 1990s, a global Hajj-associated serogroup W (MenW) outbreak in 2000–2001, and subsequent MenW epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. More recently, endemic MenW disease has expanded in South Africa, South America and the UK, and MenC cases have been reported among European and North American men who have sex with men (MSM). Routine typing schemes poorly resolve cc11 so we established the population structure at genomic resolution. Representatives of these episodes and other geo-temporally diverse cc11 meningococci (n = 750) were compared across 1546 core genes and visualised on phylogenetic networks. MenW isolates were confined to a distal portion of one of two main lineages with MenB and MenC isolates interspersed elsewhere. An expanding South American/UK MenW strain was distinct from the ‘Hajj outbreak’ strain and a closely related endemic South African strain. Recent MenC isolates from MSM in France and the UK were closely related but distinct. High resolution ‘genomic’ multilocus sequence typing is necessary to resolve and monitor the spread of diverse cc11 lineages globally.   ",

        "abstract": "Meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis remains an important health problem in many parts of the world, and there are currently no comprehensive vaccines. Poor immunogenicity, combined with immunological identity to human sialic acids, have hindered the development of a serogroup B conjugate vaccine, resulting in the development of alternative vaccine candidates, including many outer-membrane protein (OMP)-based formulations. However, the design of protein-based meningococcal vaccines is complicated by the high level of genetic and antigenic diversity of the meningococcus. Knowledge of the extent and structuring of this diversity can have implications for the use of particular proteins as potential vaccine candidates. With this in mind, the diversity of the meningococcal OMP HmbR was investigated among N. meningitidis isolates representative of major hyper-invasive lineages. In common with other meningococcal antigens, the genetic diversity of hmbR resulted from a combination of intraspecies horizontal genetic exchange and de novo mutation. Furthermore, genealogical analysis showed an association of hmbR genes with clonal complexes and the occurrence of two hmbR families, A and B. Three variable regions (VR1–VR3), located in loops 2, 3 and 4, were observed with clonal complex structuring of VR types. A minority of codons (3.9 %), located within putative surface-exposed loop regions of a 2D model, were under diversifying selection, indicating regions of the protein likely to be subject to immune attack.",

        "abstract": "The genetic structure of bacterial populations can be related to geographical locations of isolation. In some species, there is a strong correlation between geographical distance and genetic distance, which can be caused by different evolutionary mechanisms. Patterns of ancient admixture in Helicobacter pylori can be reconstructed in concordance with past human migration, whereas in Mycobacterium tuberculosis it is the lack of recombination that causes allopatric clusters. In Campylobacter, analyses of genomic data and molecular typing have been successful in determining the reservoir host species, but not geographical origin. We investigated biogeographical variation in highly recombining genes to determine the extent of clustering between genomes from geographically distinct Campylobacter populations. Whole‐genome sequences from 294 Campylobacter isolates from North America and the UK were analysed. Isolates from within the same country shared more recently recombined DNA than isolates from different countries. Using 15 UK/American closely matched pairs of isolates that shared ancestors, we identify regions that have frequently and recently recombined to test their correlation with geographical origin. The seven genes that demonstrated the greatest clustering by geography were used in an attribution model to infer geographical origin which was tested using a further 383 UK clinical isolates to detect signatures of recent foreign travel. Patient records indicated that in 46 cases, travel abroad had occurred <2 weeks prior to sampling, and genomic analysis identified that 34 (74%) of these isolates were of a non‐UK origin. Identification of biogeographical markers in Campylobacter genomes will contribute to improved source attribution of clinical Campylobacter infection and inform intervention strategies to reduce campylobacteriosis.",

        "abstract": "Asexual bacterial populations inevitably consist of an assemblage of distinct clonal lineages. However, bacterial populations are not entirely asexual since recombinational exchanges occur, mobilizing small genome segments among lineages and species. The relative contribution of recombination, as opposed to de novo mutation, in the generation of new bacterial genotypes varies among bacterial populations and, as this contribution increases, the clonality of a given population decreases. In consequence, a spectrum of possible population structures exists, with few bacterial species occupying the extremes of highly clonal and completely non–clonal, most containing both clonal and non–clonal elements. The analysis of collections of bacterial isolates, which accurately represent the natural population, by nucleotide sequence determination of multiple housekeeping loci provides data that can be used both to investigate the population structure of bacterial pathogens and for the molecular characterization of bacterial isolates. Understanding the population structure of a given pathogen is important since it impacts on the questions that can be addressed by, and the methods and samples required for, effective molecular epidemiological studies.",

        "abstract": "We submitted a panel of 416 isolates of Candida albicans from separate sources to multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The data generated determined a population structure in which four major clades of closely related isolates were delineated, together with eight minor clades comprising five or more isolates. By Fisher's exact test, a statistically significant association was found between particular clades and the anatomical source, geographical source, ABC genotype, decade of isolation, and homozygosity versus heterozygosity at the mating type-like locus (MTL) of the isolates in the clade. However, these associations may have been influenced by confounding variables, since in a univariate analysis of variance, only the clade associations with ABC type and anatomical source emerged as statistically significant, providing the first indication of possible differences between C. albicans strain type clades and their propensity to infect or colonize different anatomical locations. There were no significant differences between clades with respect to distributions of isolates resistant to fluconazole, itraconazole, or flucytosine. However, the majority of flucytosine-resistant isolates belonged to clade 1, and these isolates, but not flucytosine-resistant isolates in other clades, bore a unique mutation in the FUR1 gene that probably accounts for their resistance. A significantly higher proportion of isolates resistant to fluconazole, itraconazole, and flucytosine were homozygous at the MTL, suggesting that antifungal pressure may trigger a common mechanism that leads both to resistance and to MTL homozygosity. The utility of MLST for determining clade assignments of clinical isolates will form the basis for strain selection for future research into C. albicans virulence.",

Our analysis demonstrated that all but one of the hyperinvasive isolates established by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis and MLST were grouped into one of six genealogical lineages, each of which contained substantial variation. Due to the confounding effect of recombination, evolutionary relationships among these lineages remained unclear, even using 20 loci. Analyses of the seven loci in the standard MLST scheme using the same methods reproduced this classification, but were unable to support finer inferences concerning the relationships between the members within each complex.",

        "abstract": "Previously we have shown that insertion of IS1301 in the sia/ctr intergenic region (IGR) of serogroup C Neisseria meningitidis (MenC) isolates from Spain confers increased resistance against complement-mediated killing. Here we investigate the significance of IS1301 in the same location in N. meningitidis isolates from the UK. PCR and sequencing was used to screen a collection of more than 1500 meningococcal carriage and disease isolates from the UK for the presence of IS1301 in the IGR. IS1301 was not identified in the IGR among vaccine failure strains but was frequently found in serogroup B isolates (MenB) from clonal complex 269 (cc269). Almost all IS1301 insertions in cc269 were associated with novel polymorphisms, and did not change capsule expression or resistance to human complement. After excluding sequence types (STs) distant from the central genotype within cc269, there was no significant difference for the presence of IS1301 in the IGR of carriage isolates compared to disease isolates. Isolates with insertion of IS1301 in the IGR are not responsible for MenC disease in UK vaccine failures. Novel polymorphisms associated with IS1301 in the IGR of UK MenB isolates do not lead to the resistance phenotype seen for IS1301 in the IGR of MenC isolates.",

        "abstract": "Despite being the agent of life-threatening meningitis, Neisseria meningitidis is usually carried asymptomatically in the nasopharynx of humans and only occasionally causes disease. The genetic bases for virulence have not been entirely elucidated and the search for new virulence factors in this species is hampered by the lack of an animal model representative of the human disease. As an alternative strategy we employ a molecular epidemiological approach to establish a statistical association of a candidate virulence gene with disease in the human population. We examine the distribution of a previously-identified genetic element, a temperate bacteriophage, in 1288 meningococci isolated from cases of disease and asymptomatic carriage. The phage was over-represented in disease isolates from young adults indicating that it may contribute to invasive disease in this age group. Further statistical analysis indicated that between 20% and 45% of the pathogenic potential of the five most common disease-causing meningococcal groups was linked to the presence of the phage. In the absence of an animal model of human disease, this molecular epidemiological approach permitted the estimation of the influence of the candidate virulence factor. Such an approach is particularly valuable in the investigation of exclusively human diseases.",

        "abstract": "Representative strains of the Bacillus cereus group of bacteria, including Bacillus anthracis (11 isolates), B. cereus (38 isolates), Bacillus mycoides (1 isolate), Bacillus thuringiensis (53 isolates from 17 serovars), and Bacillus weihenstephanensis (2 isolates) were assigned to 59 sequence types (STs) derived from the nucleotide sequences of seven alleles, glpF, gmk, ilvD, pta, pur, pycA, and tpi. Comparisons of the maximum likelihood (ML) tree of the concatenated sequences with individual gene trees showed more congruence than expected by chance, indicating a generally clonal structure to the population. The STs followed two major lines of descent. Clade 1 comprised B. anthracis strains, numerous B. cereus strains, and rare B. thuringiensis strains, while clade 2 included the majority of the B. thuringiensis strains together with some B. cereus strains. Other species were allocated to a third, heterogeneous clade. The ML trees and split decomposition analysis were used to assign STs to eight lineages within clades 1 and 2. These lineages were defined by bootstrap analysis and by a preponderance of fixed differences over shared polymorphisms among the STs. Lineages were named with reference to existing designations: Anthracis, Cereus I, Cereus II, Cereus III, Kurstaki, Sotto, Thuringiensis, and Tolworthi. Strains from some B. thuringiensis serovars were wholly or largely assigned to a single ST, for example, serovar aizawai isolates were assigned to ST-15, serovar kenyae isolates were assigned to ST-13, and serovar tolworthi isolates were assigned to ST-23, while other serovars, such as serovar canadensis, were genetically heterogeneous. We suggest a revision of the nomenclature in which the lineage and clone are recognized through name and ST designations in accordance with the clonal structure of the population.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "The bacterial core genome is of intense interest and the volume of whole genome sequence data in the public domain available to investigate it has increased dramatically. The aim of our study was to develop a model to estimate the bacterial core genome from next-generation whole genome sequencing data and use this model to identify novel genes associated with important biological functions. Five bacterial datasets were analysed, comprising 2096 genomes in total. We developed a Bayesian decision model to estimate the number of core genes, calculated pairwise evolutionary distances (p-distances) based on nucleotide sequence diversity, and plotted the median p-distance for each core gene relative to its genome location. We designed visually-informative genome diagrams to depict areas of interest in genomes. Case studies demonstrated how the model could identify areas for further study, e.g. 25% of the core genes with higher sequence diversity in the Campylobacter jejuni and Neisseria meningitidis genomes encoded hypothetical proteins. The core gene with the highest p-distance value in C. jejuni was annotated in the reference genome as a putative hydrolase, but further work revealed that it shared sequence homology with beta-lactamase/metallo-beta-lactamases (enzymes that provide resistance to a range of broad-spectrum antibiotics) and thioredoxin reductase genes (which reduce oxidative stress and are essential for DNA replication) in other C. jejuni genomes. Our Bayesian model of estimating the core genome is principled, easy to use and can be applied to large genome datasets. This study also highlighted the lack of knowledge currently available for many core genes in bacterial genomes of significant global public health importance.",

        "abstract": "Molecular analyses were applied to the genes encoding variants of the serosubtyping antigen, the class 1outer membrane protein (PorA), from 55 serogroup A Neisseria meningitidis strains. These genes were evolutionarily stable and exhibited a limited range of genetic variation, primarily generated by recombination. Translation of the gene sequences revealed a total of 19 distinct amino acid sequences in the variable regions of the protein, 6 of which were not recognized by currently available serosubtyping monoclonal antibodies. Knowledge of these aminoacid sequences permitted a rational re‐assignment of serosubtype names. Comparison of the complete genes with porA gene sequences from serogroup B and C meningococci showed that serogroup A possessed a limited number of the possible porA genes from a globally distributed gene pool. Each serogroup A subgroup was characterized by one of four porA gene types, probably acquired upon subgroup divergence, which was stable over periods of decades and during epidemiological spread. Comparison with other variable genes (pil and iga) indicated that the three alleles were independently assorted within the subgroup, suggesting that their gene types were older than the subgroups in which they occurred.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "The emerging genomic technologies and bioinformatics provide novel opportunities for studying life-threatening human pathogens and to develop new applications for the improvement of human and animal health and the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infections. Based on the ecology and population biology of pathogens and related organisms and their connection to epidemiology, more accurate typing technologies and approaches will lead to better means of disease control. The analysis of the genome plasticity and gene pools of pathogenic bacteria including antigenic diversity and antigenic variation results in more effective vaccines and vaccine implementation programs. The study of newly identified and uncultivated microorganisms enables the identification of new threats. The scrutiny of the metabolism of the pathogen in the host allows the identification of new targets for anti-infectives and therapeutic approaches. The development of modulators of host responses and mediators of host damage will be facilitated by the research on interactions of microbes and hosts, including mechanisms of host damage, acute and chronic relationships as well as commensalisms. The study of multiple pathogenic and non-pathogenic microbes interacting in the host will improve the management of multiple infections and will allow probiotic and prebiotic interventions. Needless to iterate, the application of the results of improved prevention and treatment of infections into clinical tests will have a positive impact on the management of human and animal disease. The Pathogenomics Research Agenda draws on discussions with experts of the Network of Excellence “EuroPathoGenomics” at the management board meeting of the project held during 18–21 April 2007, in the Villa Vigoni, Menaggio, Italy. Based on a proposed European Research Agenda in the field of pathogenomics by the ERA-NET PathoGenoMics the meeting's participants updated the established list of topics as the research agenda for the future.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "FrpB is an outer membrane transporter from Neisseria meningitidis, the causative agent of meningococcal meningitis. It is a member of the TonB-dependent transporter (TBDT) family and is responsible for iron uptake into the periplasm. FrpB is subject to a high degree of antigenic variation, principally through a region of hypervariable sequence exposed at the cell surface. From the crystal structures of two FrpB antigenic variants, we identify a bound ferric ion within the structure which induces structural changes on binding which are consistent with it being the transported substrate. Binding experiments, followed by elemental analysis, verified that FrpB binds Fe3+ with high affinity. EPR spectra of the bound Fe3+ ion confirmed that its chemical environment was consistent with that observed in the crystal structure. Fe3+ binding was reduced or abolished on mutation of the Fe3+ -chelating residues. FrpB orthologs were identified in other Gram-negative bacteria which showed absolute conservation of the coordinating residues, suggesting the existence of a specific TBDT sub-family dedicated to the transport of Fe3+ . The region of antigenic hypervariability lies in a separate, external sub-domain, whose structure is conserved in both the F3-3 and F5-1 variants, despite their sequence divergence. We conclude that the antigenic sub-domain has arisen separately as a result of immune selection pressure to distract the immune response from the primary transport function. This would enable FrpB to function as a transporter independently of antibody binding, by using the antigenic sub-domain as a ‘molecular decoy’ to distract immune surveillance.",

        "abstract": "Detection of meningococcal carriers is key to understanding the epidemiology of Neisseria meningitidis, yet no gold standard has been established. Here, we directly compare two methods for collecting pharyngeal swabs to identify meningococcal carriers. We conducted cross-sectional surveys of schoolchildren at multiple sites in Africa to compare swabbing the posterior pharynx behind the uvula (U) to swabbing the posterior pharynx behind the uvula plus one tonsil (T). Swabs were cultured immediately and analyzed using molecular methods. One thousand and six paired swab samples collected from schoolchildren in four countries were analyzed. Prevalence of meningococcal carriage was 6.9% (95% CI: 5.4-8.6%) based on the results from both swabs, but the observed prevalence was lower based on one swab type alone. Prevalence based on the T swab or the U swab alone was similar (5.2% (95% CI: 3.8-6.7%) versus 4.9% (95% CI: 3.6-6.4%) respectively (p=0.6)). The concordance between the two methods was 96.3% and the kappa was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.50-0.73), indicating good agreement. These two commonly used methods for collecting pharyngeal swabs provide consistent estimates of the prevalence of carriage, but both methods misclassified carriers to some degree, leading to underestimates of the prevalence.",

        "abstract": "The global significance of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli as gastrointestinal human pathogens has motivated numerous studies to characterize their population biology and evolution. These bacteria are a common component of the intestinal microbiota of numerous bird and mammal species and cause disease in humans, typically via consumption of contaminated meat products, especially poultry meat. Sequence-based molecular typing methods, such as multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and whole genome sequencing (WGS), have been instructive for understanding the epidemiology and evolution of these bacteria and how phenotypic variation relates to the high degree of genetic structuring in C. coli and C. jejuni populations. Here, we describe aspects of the relatively short history of coevolution between humans and pathogenic Campylobacter, by reviewing research investigating how mutation and lateral or horizontal gene transfer (LGT or HGT, respectively) interact to create the observed population structure. These genetic changes occur in a complex fitness landscape with divergent ecologies, including multiple host species, which can lead to rapid adaptation, for example, through frame-shift mutations that alter gene expression or the acquisition of novel genetic elements by HGT. Recombination is a particularly strong evolutionary force in Campylobacter, leading to the emergence of new lineages and even large-scale genome-wide interspecies introgression between C. jejuni and C. coli. The increasing availability of large genome datasets is enhancing understanding of Campylobacter evolution through the application of methods, such as genome-wide association studies, but MLST-derived clonal complex designations remain a useful method for describing population structure.",

Preliminary population genomic studies have explored the relationships among three closely related bacteria, Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria lactamica, which exhibit very different phenotypes with respect to human colonisation. The data obtained have been especially valuable in the establishing of the role of horizontal genetic exchange in bacterial speciation and shaping population structure. In the meningococcus, they have been used to define invasive genetic types, search for virulence factors and potential vaccine components and investigate the effects of vaccines on population structure.

        "abstract": "Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup Y has increased in Europe, especially in Scandinavia. In Sweden, serogroup Y is now the dominating serogroup, and in 2012, the serogroup Y disease incidence was 0.46/100,000 population. We previously showed that a strain type belonging to sequence type 23 was responsible for the increased prevalence of this serogroup in Sweden. The objective of this study was to investigate the serogroup Y emergence by whole-genome sequencing and compare the meningococcal population structure of Swedish invasive serogroup Y strains to those of other countries with different IMD incidence. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on invasive serogroup Y isolates from 1995 to 2012 in Sweden (n = 186). These isolates were compared to a collection of serogroup Y isolates from England, Wales, and Northern Ireland from 2010 to 2012 (n = 143), which had relatively low serogroup Y incidence, and two isolates obtained in 1999 in the United States, where serogroup Y remains one of the major causes of IMD. The meningococcal population structures were similar in the investigated regions; however, different strain types were prevalent in each geographic region. A number of genes known or hypothesized to have an impact on meningococcal virulence were shown to be associated with different strain types and subtypes. The reasons for the IMD increase are multifactorial and are influenced by increased virulence, host adaptive immunity, and transmission. Future genome-wide association studies are needed to reveal additional genes associated with serogroup Y meningococcal disease, and this work would benefit from a complete serogroup Y meningococcal reference genome.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "The widespread use of meningococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccines has highlighted the challenge of providing protection against serogroup B disease. Over a period of 4 decades, vaccine development has focused on subcapsular protein antigens, first with outer membrane vesicle (OMV) vaccines against epidemic outbreaks, and more recently on new multicomponent vaccines designed to offer better cross-protection against the antigenically diverse strains responsible for endemic disease. Because of the low incidence of meningococcal disease, the protective efficacy of these vaccines has not been determined in clinical studies, and their licensure has been based on serological data; however, the serological assays used to predict protective coverage have limitations. As a result, evidence of the effectiveness of these vaccines against different strains and the contribution of specific antigens to protection can only be provided by epidemiological analyses following their implementation in sufficiently large populations. The recent inclusion of the four-component meningococcal serogroup B (4CMenB) vaccine, Bexsero, in the infant immunization program in the UK has provided preliminary evidence that the vaccine is effective. Ongoing surveillance will provide valuable data on its longer-term impact and antigenic coverage. Further development of protein-based vaccines against meningococcal disease is anticipated to improve antigenic coverage and adjust to changes in circulating strains. At the same time, alternative immunization strategies may be explored to improve overall vaccine effectiveness by, for example, protecting the youngest infants or providing herd protection.",

        "abstract": "Many bacteria responsible for human diseases are not pathogens in the strictest sense; rather they are commensal organisms which cause disease as a consequence of a failed or dysfunctional interaction with their host. For the pediatrician Neisseria meningitidis, the meningococcus, is perhaps the most dramatic example of such an organism. Indeed, the designation of the meningococcus as a commensal may appear to be strange or even ridiculous from a clinical perspective. Meningococcal disease, comprising the two syndromes meningitis and septicemia, is one of the most dangerous conditions that a pediatrician is likely to encounter (Brandtzaeg, 1995). Its dramatic symptoms, together with the rapidity with which it progresses, contribute to the reputation of the meningococcus as a more than usually aggressive pathogen. However, meningococcal disease is very rare relative to the universal presence of asymptomatic meningococcal carriage in human populations (Broome, 1986).",

Hypothesis-driven analyses applied to these data permit the determination of microbial population diversity and structure, the identification of the mechanisms of genetic change in bacterial populations, and the generation of models of pathogen evolution.

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Neisseria meningitidis is a common cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults worldwide. The 4CMenB vaccine (Bexsero), developed to combat meningococcal serogroup B (MenB) disease, contains subcapsular antigens that may induce immunity against strains of N. meningitidis, regardless of serogroup. Owing to differential levels of expression and peptide diversity in vaccine antigens across meningococcal strains, the meningococcal antigen typing system (MATS) was developed to estimate the potential MenB strain coverage of 4CMenB. Prior to introducing the 4CMenB vaccine into routine use, we sought to estimate the potential 4CMenB coverage against invasive MenB strains isolated in the Republic of Ireland (RoI) over four consecutive epidemiological years. MATS was applied to a panel of 105 invasive MenB strains isolated during July 2009 to June 2013. Sequence data characterizing the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) alleles and the major 4CMenB target peptides were extracted from isolate genome sequence data, hosted in the Bacterial Isolate Sequencing database (BIGSdb). MATS data indicated that 4CMenB may induce protective immunity against 69.5% (95% confidence interval [CI95%], 64.8% to 84.8%) of circulating MenB strains. Estimated coverage was highest against the most prevalent disease-causing lineage, cc41/44, where the most frequently observed sequence types, ST-154 and ST-41 (21% of isolates, collectively), were typically covered by three antigens. No significant temporal trends were observed. Overall, these data provide a baseline of strain coverage prior to the introduction of 4CMenB and indicate that a decrease in invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is predicted following the introduction of 4CMenB into the routine infant immunization schedule in the RoI.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of serogroup C and Y meningococcal disease increased in the United States during the 1990s. The cyclical nature of endemic meningococcal disease remains unexplained. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms associated with the increase in the incidence of meningococcal disease. We characterized an increasing incidence of invasive serogroup C and Y meningococcal disease using population-based surveillance from 1992 through 2001. Isolates were characterized by multilocus sequence typing and antigen sequence typing of 3 outer membrane protein (OMP) genes: porA variable regions (VRs) 1 and 2, porB, and fetA VR. For both serogroups, OMP antigenic shifts were associated with increased incidence of meningococcal disease. For serogroup Y, antigenic shift occurred through amino acid substitutions at all 3 OMPs—PorA VR 1 and 2, PorB, and FetA VR. For serogroup C, antigenic shift involved amino acid substitutions at FetA VR and, in some cases, deletion of the porA gene. On the basis of deduced amino acid sequences, the antigenic changes likely occurred by horizontal gene transfer. Antigenic shifts were associated with increased incidence of serogroup C and serogroup Y meningococcal disease. For serogroup Y, the changes involved all OMP genes that were studied. Increases in the incidence of meningococcal disease may be caused, in part, by antigenic shift.",

We analysed the Opa repertoire structure in a large, well-characterised collection of asymptomatically carried meningococci. Our data show an association between Opa repertoire and meningococcal lineages similar to that observed previously for meningococci isolated from cases of invasive disease. Furthermore, these Opa repertoires exhibit discrete, non-overlapping structure at a population level, and yet low within-repertoire diversity.

These investigations have enabled the diversity of bacterial pathogen lifestyles to be revealed, including details of their ecology and evolution. Studies of the pathogenic Neisseria and specifically Neisseria meningitidis were in the forefront of these developments, driven in part because of the complexities of the pathobiology of this organism.

        "abstract": "There has been little research on the determinants of Campylobacter coli infection, despite its contributing up to 10% of human Campylobacter infections. A case-control and two case-case study methods explored the aetiology of C. coli over a one year period across Scotland. The case-control multivariate model found an increased risk of C. coli infection in people older than 19 years (O.R. = 3.352), and during the summer months (O.R. = 2.596), while residing in an urban area decreased the risk (O.R. = 0.546). The first case-case study compared C. coli and C. jejuni cases and also showed a higher risk of C. coli during the summer (O.R. = 1.313) and in people older than 19 years (O.R. = 0.791). Living in an urban area was associated with a reduced risk of infection (O.R. = 0.769). Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) indicated that sheep and chicken C. coli sequence types (STs) were most frequently found in humans whilst those from cattle and pigs were rarer. MLST diversity was high in isolates from pigs and chicken, intermediate in human isolates, and low in ruminant isolates. The second case-case study used MLST data to ascribe putative sources of infection to the cases. The putative source for 40% of cases was chicken, with 60% acquired from other sources (ruminants 54% and pigs 6%). The case-case analysis also showed that female gender was a risk factor (O.R. = 1.940), which may be explained by females being more likely to prepare poultry in the home. These findings indicate differences between the aetiology of C. coli and C. jejuni infections: this should be taken into account by public health professionals when developing strategies to reduce the burden of human campylobacteriosis.",

        "abstract": "Information on the biochemistry and genetics of bacterial species, usually obtained by the study of single isolates, is enhanced by studies of populations of bacteria. Recent advances in molecular technology, particularly polymerase chain reaction-based nucleotide sequence analysis, provide powerful for the study of population genetics. Data obtained by such techniques indicate that, while some bacterial species have a clonal population structure, others are non-clonal or panmictic. Clonal populations are a consequence of asexual reproduction by binary fission; panmictic population structures results from ‘horizontal’ exchange of genetic material between clones. A consequence of horizontal genetic exchange is mosaic gene structures, recognisable by comparisons of nucleotide sequences. In transformable bacteria, for example the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis, several different genes, including the gene encoding the class 1 outer membrane protein, a major surface antigen, are mosaics. This genetic process has implications both for vaccine design and in the interpretation of epidemiological data.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "A scientist in our laboratory was accidentally infected while working with Z5463, a Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A strain. She developed severe symptoms (fever, meningism, purpuric lesions) that fortunately evolved with antibiotic treatment to complete recovery. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis confirmed that the isolate obtained from the blood culture (Z5463BC) was identical to Z5463, more precisely to a fourth subculture of this strain used the week before the contamination (Z5463PI). In order to get some insights into genomic modifications that can occur in vivo, we sequenced these three isolates. All the strains contained a mutated mutS allele and therefore displayed an hypermutator phenotype, consistent with the high number of mutations (SNP, Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) detected in the three strains. By comparing the number of SNP in all three isolates and knowing the number of passages between Z5463 and Z5463PI, we concluded that around 25 bacterial divisions occurred in the human body. As expected, the in vivo passage is responsible for several modifications of phase variable genes. This genomic study has been completed by transcriptomic and phenotypic studies, showing that the blood strain used a different haemoglobin-linked iron receptor (HpuA/B) than the parental strains (HmbR). Different pilin variants were found after the in vivo passage, which expressed different properties of adhesion. Furthermore the deletion of one gene involved in LOS biosynthesis (lgtB) results in Z5463BC expressing a different LOS than the L9 immunotype of Z2491. The in vivo passage, despite the small numbers of divisions, permits the selection of numerous genomic modifications that may account for the high capacity of the strain to disseminate.",

The collection of isolates consisted of 111 GBS isolates from cows with mastitis and a diverse global collection of GBS isolates from patients with invasive disease (n = 83) and carriers (n = 69). Cluster analysis showed that the majority of the bovine isolates (93%) grouped into one phylogenetic cluster. The human isolates showed greater diversity and clustered separately from the bovine population. However, the homogeneous human sequence type 17 (ST-17) complex, known to be significantly associated with invasive neonatal disease, was the only human lineage found to be clustered within the bovine population and was distinct from all the other human lineages. Split decomposition analysis revealed that the human isolate ST-17 complex, the major hyperinvasive neonatal clone, has recently arisen from a bovine lineage.",

        "abstract": "Neisseria meningitidis is a diverse commensal bacterium that occasionally causes severe invasive disease. The relationship between meningococcal genotype and capsular polysaccharide, the principal virulence factor and vaccine component, was investigated in carried meningococci isolated from 8000 children and young adults in Bavaria, Germany. MethodsOf the 830 meningococci isolated (carriage rate, 10.4%) by microbiological techniques, 822 were characterized by serogrouping, multilocus sequence typing, and genetic analysis of the capsule region. Statistical and population genetic analyses were applied to these data. The rapid increase in carriage rates with age of carrier, the low prevalence of hyperinvasive meningococci, and the relative prevalence of the 4 disease-associated serogroups were consistent with earlier observations. There was no genetic structuring of the meningococcal population by age of carrier or sampling location; however, there was significant geographic structuring of the meningococci isolated in civil, but not military, institutions. The rate of capsule gene expression did not vary with age of carrier or meningococcal genotype, except for serogroup C, for which increased expression was associated with ST-11 (formerly ET-37) complex meningococci. Serogroup C capsule expression during carriage may contribute to the invasive character of ST-11 complex meningococci and to the high efficacy of meningococcal serogroup C conjugate polysaccharide vaccine.",

        "abstract": "One potential vaccine strategy in the fight against meningococcal disease involves the exploitation of outer-membrane components of Neisseria lactamica, a commensal bacterium closely related to the meningococcus, Neisseria meningitidis. Although N. lactamica shares many surface structures with the meningococcus, little is known about the antigenic diversity of this commensal bacterium or the antigenic relationships between N. lactamica and N. meningitidis. Here, the N. lactamica porin protein (Por) was examined and compared to the related PorB antigens of N. meningitidis, to investigate potential involvement in anti-meningococcal immunity. Relationships among porin sequences were determined using distance-based methods and FST, and maximum-likelihood analyses were used to compare the selection pressures acting on the encoded proteins. These analyses demonstrated that the N. lactamica porin was less diverse than meningococcal PorB and although it was subject to positive selection, this was not as strong as the positive selection pressures acting on the meningococcal porin. In addition, the N. lactamica porin gene sequences and the protein sequences of the loop regions predicted to be exposed to the human immune system were dissimilar to the corresponding sequences in the meningococcus. This suggests that N. lactamica Por, contrary to previous suggestions, may have limited involvement in the development of natural immunity to meningococcal disease and might not be effective as a meningococcal vaccine component.",

Samples were collected from wild Norway rats and fresh Norway rat faeces. Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) was performed on C. spp. isolates and samples were tested for arenavirus RNA by RT-PCR. Six C. spp. isolates were identified. One isolate was C. lari and five isolates were C. jejuni. Following MSLT profiling, three unique C. jejuni sequence types were identified. Two of which are novel and the third is typically associated with livestock and human infection. Nine positive results for LCMV were obtained giving an overall prevalence of 25% across four sites.

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Outer membrane vesicle (OMV) vaccines are used against outbreaks of capsular group B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB) caused by strains expressing particular PorA outer membrane proteins (OMPs). Ferric enterobactin receptor (FetA) is another variable OMP that induces type-specific bactericidal antibodies, and the combination of judiciously chosen PorA and FetA variants in vaccine formulations is a potential approach to broaden protection of such vaccines. The OMV vaccine MenPF-1 was generated by genetically modifying N. meningitidis strain 44/76 to constitutively express FetA. Three doses of 25 μg or 50 μg of MenPF-1 were delivered intra-muscularly to 52 healthy adults. MenPF-1 was safe and well tolerated. Immunogenicity was measured by serum bactericidal assay (SBA) against wild-type and isogenic mutant strains. After 3 doses, the proportion of volunteers with SBA titres ≥1:4 (the putative protective titre) was 98% for the wild-type strain, and 77% for the strain 44/76 FetAonPorAoff compared to 51% in the strain 44/76 FetAoffPorAoff, demonstrating that vaccination with MenPF-1 simultaneously induced FetA and PorA bactericidal antibodies. This study provides a proof-of-concept for generating bactericidal antibodies against FetA after OMV vaccination in humans. Prevalence-based choice of PorA and FetA types can be used to formulate a vaccine for broad protection against MenB disease.",

        "abstract": "Factor H binding protein (fHbp) is a major antigenic component of novel vaccines designed to protect against meningococcal disease. Prediction of the potential coverage of these vaccines is difficult, as fHbp is antigenically variable and levels of expression differ among isolates. Transcriptional regulation of the fHbp gene is poorly understood, although evidence suggests that oxygen availability is involved. In this study iron accessibility was found to affect fHbp transcription. However, regulation differed among meningococcal clonal complexes (ccs). For the majority of isolates, increased iron concentrations upregulated transcription. This effect was enhanced by the presence of a 181 bp insertion element upstream of fHbp, associated with isolates belonging to cc4 and cc5. Conversely, meningococci belonging to cc32 showed iron-repressed control of fHbp, as regulation was dominated by cotranscription with the iron-repressed upstream gene cbbA. These results highlight the complexity of fHbp regulation and demonstrate that control of transcription can vary among genetic lineages.",

The structure of a peptide antigen corresponding to the subtype P1.7 variant of the porin PorA from the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis was determined by solution of the X-ray crystal structure of the ternary complex of the peptide (ANGGASGQVK) in complex with a Fab fragment and a domain from streptococcal protein G to 1.95 Å resolution. The peptide adopted a β-hairpin structure with a type I β-turn between residues Gly4P and Gly7P, the conformation of the peptide being further stabilised by a pair of hydrogen bonds from the side-chain of Asn2P to main-chain atoms in Val9P. The antigen binding site within the Fab formed a distinct crevice lined by a high proportion of apolar amino acids. Recognition was supplemented by hydrogen bonds from heavy chain residues Thr50H, Asp95H, Leu97H and Tyr100H to main-chain and side-chain atoms in the peptide. Complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3 of the heavy chain was responsible for approximately 50 % of the buried surface area formed by peptide-Fab binding, with the remainder made up from CDRs 1 and 3 of the light chain and CDRs 1 and 2 of the heavy chain.

        "abstract": "The currently used serological subtyping scheme for the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis is not comprehensive, a proportion of isolates are reported as not subtypeable (NST), and few isolates are fully characterized with two subtypes for each strain. To establish the reasons for this and to assess the effectiveness of DNA-based subtyping schemes, dot blot hybridization and nucleotide sequence analyses were used to characterize the genes encoding antigenic variants of the meningococcal subtyping antigen, the PorA protein. A total of 233 strains, including 174 serologically NST and 59 partially or completely subtyped meningococcal strains, were surveyed. The NST isolates were chosen to be temporally and geographically representative of NST strains, isolated in England and Wales, and submitted to the Meningococcal Reference Unit in the period 1989 to 1991. The DNA-based analyses demonstrated that all of the strains examined possessed a porA gene. Some of these strains were serologically NST because of a lack of monoclonal antibodies against certain PorA epitopes; in other cases, strains expressed minor variants of known PorA epitopes that did not react with monoclonal antibodies in serological assays. Lack of expression remained a possible explanation for serological typing failure in some cases. These findings have important implications for epidemiological analysis and vaccine design and demonstrate the need for genetic characterization, rather than phenotypic characterization using monoclonal antibodies, for the identification of meningococcal strains.",

        "abstract": "Meningococcal conjugate vaccines protect individuals directly, but can also confer herd protection by interrupting carriage transmission. We assessed the effects of meningococcal quadrivalent glycoconjugate (MenACWY-CRM) or serogroup B (4CMenB) vaccination on meningococcal carriage rates in 18–24-year-olds. In this phase 3, observer-blind, randomised controlled trial, university students aged 18–24 years from ten sites in England were randomly assigned (1:1:1, block size of three) to receive two doses 1 month apart of Japanese Encephalitis vaccine (controls), 4CMenB, or one dose of MenACWY-CRM then placebo. Participants were randomised with a validated computer-generated random allocation list. Participants and outcome-assessors were masked to the treatment group. Meningococci were isolated from oropharyngeal swabs collected before vaccination and at five scheduled intervals over 1 year. Primary outcomes were cross-sectional carriage 1 month after each vaccine course. Secondary outcomes included comparisons of carriage at any timepoint after primary analysis until study termination. Reactogenicity and adverse events were monitored throughout the study. Analysis was done on the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all enrolled participants who received a study vaccination and provided at least one assessable swab after baseline. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, registration number NCT01214850. Between Sept 21 and Dec 21, 2010, 2954 participants were randomly assigned (987 assigned to control [984 analysed], 979 assigned to 4CMenB [974 analysed], 988 assigned to MenACWY-CRM [983 analysed]); 33% of the 4CMenB group, 34% of the MenACWY-CRM group, and 31% of the control group were positive for meningococcal carriage at study entry. By 1 month, there was no significant difference in carriage between controls and 4CMenB (odds ratio 1·2, 95% CI 0·8–1·7) or MenACWY-CRM (0·9, [0·6–1·3]) groups. From 3 months after dose two, 4CMenB vaccination resulted in significantly lower carriage of any meningococcal strain (18·2% [95% CI 3·4–30·8] carriage reduction), capsular groups BCWY (26·6% [10·5–39·9] carriage reduction), capsular groups CWY (29·6% [8·1–46·0] carriage reduction), and serogroups CWY (28·5% [2·8–47·5] carriage reduction) compared with control vaccination. Significantly lower carriage rates were also noted in the MenACWY-CRM group compared with controls: 39·0% (95% CI 17·3–55·0) carriage reduction for serogroup Y and 36·2% (15·6–51·7) carriage reduction for serogroup CWY. Study vaccines were generally well tolerated, with increased rates of transient local injection pain and myalgia in the 4CMenB group. No safety concerns were identified.",

MLST differentiated all nine current BCC species and identified 114 sequence types within a collection of 119 strains. No differentiation was found between strains recovered from environmental or clinical sources. The improved resolution in strain identification offered by MLST was able to identify previously characterized epidemic strain lineages and also demonstrated the presence of four novel potential species groups within the complex. There was also evidence for recombination having an important role in the recent evolution of individual BCC species. This highly transferable, validated, MLST scheme provides a new means to assist in species identification as well as unambiguous strain discrimination of the BCC by a single approach. It is also the first MLST scheme designed at the outset to incorporate multiple species and should facilitate global epidemiological investigations of the BCC.",

        "abstract": "Understanding predisposing factors for meningococcal carriage may identify targets for public health interventions. Before mass vaccination with meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine began in autumn 1999, we took pharyngeal swabs from ≈14,000 UK teenagers and collected information on potential risk factors. Neisseria meningitidis was cultured from 2,319 (16.7%) of 13,919 swabs. In multivariable analysis, attendance at pubs/clubs, intimate kissing, and cigarette smoking were each independently and strongly associated with increased risk for meningococcal carriage (p<0.001). Carriage in those with none of these risk factors was 7.8%, compared to 32.8% in those with all 3. Passive smoking was also linked to higher risk for carriage, but age, sex, social deprivation, home crowding, or school characteristics had little or no effect. Social behavior, rather than age or sex, can explain the higher frequency of meningococcal carriage among teenagers. A ban on smoking in public places may reduce risk for transmission.",

A total of 645 C. jejuni and 106 C. coli isolates were obtained from 32 flocks and 17 farms, with 47 sequence types (STs) identified. The Campylobacter jejuni isolates obtained by different sampling approaches and laboratory methods were very similar, with the same STs identified at similar frequencies, and had no major effect on the genetic profile of Campylobacter population in broiler flocks at the farm level. For C. coli, the results were more equivocal. While some STs were widely distributed within and among farms and flocks, analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed a high degree of genetic diversity among farms for C. jejuni, where farm effects accounted for 70.5% of variance, and among flocks from the same farm (9.9% of variance for C. jejuni and 64.1% for C. coli). These results show the complexity of the population structure of Campylobacter in broiler production and that commercial broiler farms provide an ecological niche for a wide diversity of genotypes. The genetic diversity of C. jejuni isolates among broiler farms should be taken into account when designing studies to understand Campylobacter populations in broiler production and the impact of interventions. We provide evidence that supports synthesis of studies on C. jejuni populations even when laboratory and sampling methods are not identical.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Neisseria meningitidis can utilize haem, haemoglobin and haemoglobin–haptoglobin complexes as sources of iron via two TonB-dependent phase variable haemoglobin receptors, HmbR and HpuAB. HmbR is over-represented in disease isolates, suggesting a link between haemoglobin acquisition and meningococcal disease. This study compared the distribution of HpuAB and phase variation (PV) status of both receptors in disease and carriage isolates. Meningococcal disease (n = 214) and carriage (n = 305) isolates representative of multiple clonal complexes (CCs) were investigated for the distribution, polyG tract lengths and ON/OFF status of both haemoglobin receptors, and for the deletion mechanism for HpuAB. Strains with both receptors or only hmbR were present at similar frequencies among meningococcal disease isolates as compared with carriage isolates. However, >90 % of isolates from the three CCs CC5, CC8 and CC11 with the highest disease to carriage ratios contained both receptors. Strains with an hpuAB-only phenotype were under-represented among disease isolates, suggesting selection against this receptor during systemic disease, possibly due to the receptor having a high level of immunogenicity or being inefficient in acquisition of iron during systemic spread. Absence of hpuAB resulted from either complete deletion or replacement by an insertion element. In an examination of PV status, one or both receptors were found in an ON state in 91 % of disease and 71 % of carriage isolates. We suggest that expression of a haemoglobin receptor, either HmbR or HpuAB, is of major importance for systemic spread of meningococci, and that the presence of both receptors contributes to virulence in some strains.",

A primer set for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the genes encoding these antigens was devised. Low-stringency amplification of meningococcal chromosomal DNA with this primer set resulted in the amplification of two products from each strain, whereas at higher stringencies only one product was amplified in most strains. Southern hybridization techniques and restriction analyses were used to differentiate the PCR products amplified at high stringencies from strains expressing class 2 or class 3 OMPs; these PCR products were further characterized by the determination of their nucleotide sequences, confirming that they represented the amplified class 2 and class 3 OMP genes. Analyses of these and other nucleotide sequences enabled the construction of a phenogram illustrating the interrelationships between Neisseria OMP genes. The comparative analysis of deduced amino acid sequences revealed conserved and variable regions of the proteins; the latter probably correspond to surface loops on the protein and hence are potentially exposed to the immune system. Further analyses of the primary structures of these related porins from Neisseria species enabled construction of models of the secondary structure of these antigens and comparison of these models with those previously published. The methods reported in the present work are rapid reproducible procedures for the analysis of antigenic variants of these proteins.",

        "abstract": "Whole-cell matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a rapid method for identification of microorganisms that is increasingly used in microbiology laboratories. This identification is based on the comparison of the tested isolate mass spectrum with reference databases. Using Neisseria meningitidis as a model organism, we showed that in one of the available databases, the Andromas database, 10 of the 13 species-specific biomarkers correspond to ribosomal proteins. Remarkably, one biomarker, ribosomal protein L32, was subject to inter-strain variability. The analysis of the ribosomal protein patterns of 100 isolates for which whole genome sequences were available, confirmed the presence of inter-strain variability in the molecular weight of 29 ribosomal proteins, thus establishing a correlation between the sequence type (ST) and/or clonal complex (CC) of each strain and its ribosomal protein pattern. Since the molecular weight of three of the variable ribosomal proteins (L30, L31 and L32) was included in the spectral window observed by MALDI-TOF MS in clinical microbiology, i.e., 3640–12000 m/z, we were able by analyzing the molecular weight of these three ribosomal proteins to classify each strain in one of six subgroups, each of these subgroups corresponding to specific STs and/or CCs. Their detection by MALDI-TOF allows therefore a quick typing of N. meningitidis isolates.",

        "abstract": "Two new species, Candida orthopsilosis and C. metapsilosis, are proposed to replace the existing designations of C. parapsilosis groups II and III, respectively. The species C. parapsilosis is retained for group I isolates. Attempts to construct a multilocus sequence typing scheme to differentiate individual strains of C. parapsilosis instead revealed fixed DNA sequence differences between pairs of subgroups in four genes: COX3, L1A1, SADH, and SYA1. PCR amplicons for sequencing were obtained for these four plus a further seven genes from 21 group I isolates. For nine group II isolates, PCR products were obtained from only 5 of the 11 genes, and for two group III isolates PCR products were obtained from a different set of 5 genes. Three of the PCR products from group II and III isolates differed in size from the group I products. Cluster analysis of sequence polymorphisms from COX3, SADH, and SYA1, which were common to the three groups, consistently separated the isolates into three distinct sets. All of these differences, together with DNA sequence similarities <90% in the ITS1 sequence, suggest the subgroups should be afforded species status. The near absence of DNA sequence variability among isolates of C. parapsilosis and relatively high levels of sequence variability among isolates of C. orthopsilosis suggest that the former species may have evolved very recently from the latter.",

        "abstract": "DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) activity is absent in many, but not all, disease isolates of Neisseria meningitidis, as a consequence of the insertion of a restriction endonuclease-encoding gene, the 'dam replacing gene' (drg) at the dam locus. Here, we report the results of a survey to assess the prevalence of drg in a globally representative panel of disease-associated meningococci. Of the known meningococcal hyper-invasive lineages investigated, drg was absent in all representatives of the ST-8 and ST-11 clonal complexes tested, but uniformly present in the representatives of the other hyper-invasive lineages present in the isolate collection (the ST-1, ST-4, ST-5, ST-32 and ST-41/44 clonal complexes). The patterns of sequence diversity observed in drg were consistent with acquisition of this gene from a source organism with a different G+C content, at some time prior to the emergence of present-day meningococcal clonal complexes, followed by spread through the meningococcal population by horizontal genetic exchange. During this spread a number of alleles have arisen by mutation and intragenic recombination. These findings are consistent with the idea that possession of the drg gene may contribute to the divergence observed among meningococcal clonal complexes, but does not have a direct mechanistic involvement in virulence.",

        "abstract": "Molecular typing is used to differentiate microorganisms at the subspecies or strain level for epidemiological investigations, infection control, public health and environmental sampling. DNA sequence-based typing methods require authoritative databases that link sequence variants to nomenclature in order to facilitate communication and comparison of identified types in national or global settings. The PubMLST website (https://pubmlst.org/) fulfils this role for over a hundred microorganisms for which it hosts curated molecular sequence typing data, providing sequence and allelic profile definitions for multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and single-gene typing approaches. In recent years, these have expanded to cover the whole genome with schemes such as core genome MLST (cgMLST) and whole genome MLST (wgMLST) which catalogue the allelic diversity found in hundreds to thousands of genes. These approaches provide a common nomenclature for high-resolution strain characterization and comparison. Molecular typing information is linked to isolate provenance, phenotype, and increasingly genome assemblies, providing a resource for outbreak investigation and research in to population structure, gene association, global epidemiology and vaccine coverage. A Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) has been developed for the PubMLST website to make these large quantities of structured molecular typing and whole genome sequence data available for programmatic access by any third party application. The API is an integral component of the Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence Database (BIGSdb) platform that is used to host PubMLST resources, and exposes all public data within the site. In addition to data browsing, searching and download, the API supports authentication and submission of new data to curator queues.",

        "abstract": "The pneumococcus is a leading global pathogen and a key virulence factor possessed by the majority of pneumococci is an antigenic polysaccharide capsule (‘serotype’), which is encoded by the capsular (cps) locus. Approximately 100 different serotypes are known, but the extent of sequence diversity within the cps loci of individual serotypes is not well understood. Investigating serotype-specific sequence variation is crucial to the design of sequence-based serotyping methodology, understanding pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) effectiveness and the design of future PCVs. The availability of large genome datasets makes it possible to assess population-level variation among pneumococcal serotypes and in this study 5405 pneumococcal genomes were used to investigate cps locus diversity among 49 different serotypes. Pneumococci had been recovered between 1916 and 2014 from people of all ages living in 51 countries. Serotypes were deduced bioinformatically, cps locus sequences were extracted and variation was assessed within the cps locus, in the context of pneumococcal genetic lineages. Overall, cps locus sequence diversity varied markedly: low to moderate diversity was revealed among serogroups/types 1, 3, 7, 9, 11 and 22; whereas serogroups/types 6, 19, 23, 14, 15, 18, 33 and 35 displayed high diversity. Putative novel and/or hybrid cps loci were identified among all serogroups/types apart from 1, 3 and 9. This study demonstrated that cps locus sequence diversity varied widely between serogroups/types. Investigation of the biochemical structure of the polysaccharide capsule of major variants, particularly PCV-related serotypes and those that appear to be novel or hybrids, is warranted.",

        "abstract": "Horizontal genetic exchange strongly influences the evolution of many bacteria, substantially contributing to difficulties in defining their position in taxonomic groups. In particular, how clusters of related bacterial genotypes – currently classified as microbiological species – evolve and are maintained remains controversial. The nature and magnitude of gene exchange between two closely related (approx. 15 % nucleotide divergence) microbiologically defined species, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, was investigated by the examination of mosaic alleles, those with some ancestry from each population. A total of 1738 alleles from 2953 seven-locus housekeeping gene sequence types (STs) were probabilistically assigned to each species group with the model-based clustering algorithm structure. Alleles with less than 75 % assignment probability to one of the populations were confirmed as mosaics using the structure linkage model. For each of these, the putative source of the recombinant region was determined and the allele was mapped onto a clonalframe genealogy derived from concatenated ST sequences. This enabled the direction and frequency of introgression between the two populations to be established, with 8.3 % of C. coli clade 1 alleles having acquired C. jejuni sequence, compared to 0.5 % for the reciprocal process. Once generated, mosaic genes spread within C. coli clade 1 by a combination of clonal expansion and lateral gene transfer, with some evidence of erosion of the mosaics by reacquisition of C. coli sequence. These observations confirm previous analyses of the exchange of complete housekeeping alleles and extend this work by describing the processes of horizontal gene transfer and subsequent spread within recipient species.",

These data have the advantage of providing detailed information on the genotypes and likely phenotypes of aetiological agents, enabling the relationships of samples from potential disease outbreaks to be established precisely. However, the generation of increasing quantities of sequence data does not, in itself, resolve the problems that a wide variety of microbiological typing methods have addressed over the last 100 years or so; indeed, the provision of very high volumes of unstructured data can confuse rather than resolve these issues. Here we review the nascent field of the storage of WGS data for clinical application and show how curated sequence-based typing schemes on websites such as PubMLST.org, accumulated over the past 14 years or so, has generated an infrastructure that can be used to exploit WGS for bacterial typing efficiently. We review the tools that have been implemented within the PubMLST.org website to extract clinically useful, strain characterisation information which can be provided to physicians and public health scientists and officials in a timely, concise and understandable way. These data can be used to inform medical decisions such as how to treat a patient, whether to institute public health action, and what action might be appropriate. The information is compatible both with previous sequence-based typing data and also with data that can be obtained in the absence of WGS data, for example by real-time PCR tests, providing a flexible infrastructure for WGS-based clinical microbiology.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Pathogenic meningococci have acquired a 24 kb capsule synthesis island (cps) by horizontal gene transfer which consists of a synthetic locus and associated capsule transport genes flanked by repetitive Regions D and D’. Regions D and D’ contain an intact gene encoding a UDP-galactose epimerase (galE1) and a truncated remnant (galE2), respectively. In this study, GalE protein alleles were shown to be either mono-functional, synthesising UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal), or bi-functional, synthesising UDP-Gal and UDP-galactosamine (UDP-GalNAc). Meningococci possessing a capsule null locus (cnl) typically possessed a single bi-functional galE. Separation of functionality between galE1 and galE2 alleles in meningococcal isolates was retained for all serogroups except serogroup E which has a synthetic requirement for UDP-GalNAc. The truncated galE2 remnant in Region D’ was also phylogenetically related to the bi-functional galE of the cnl locus suggesting common ancestry. A model is proposed in which the illegitimate recombination of the cps island into the galE allele of the cnl locus results in the formation of Region D’ containing the truncated galE2 locus and the capture of the cps island en bloc. The retention of the duplicated Regions D and D’ enables inversion of the synthetic locus within the cps island during bacterial growth.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Traditional and molecular typing schemes for the characterization of pathogenic microorganisms are poorly portable because they index variation that is difficult to compare among laboratories. To overcome these problems, we propose multilocus sequence typing (MLST), which exploits the unambiguous nature and electronic portability of nucleotide sequence data for the characterization of microorganisms. To evaluate MLST, we determined the sequences of '470-bp fragments from 11 housekeeping genes in a reference set of 107 isolates of Neisseria meningitidis from invasive disease and healthy carriers. For each locus, alleles were assigned arbitrary numbers and dendrograms were constructed from the pairwise differences in multilocus allelic profiles by cluster analysis. The strain associations obtained were consistent with clonal groupings previously determined by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. A subset of six gene fragments was chosen that retained the resolution and congruence achieved by using all 11 loci. Most isolates from hyper-virulent lineages of serogroups A, B, and C meningococci were identical for all loci or differed from the majority type at only a single locus. MLST using six loci therefore reliably identified the major meningococcal lineages associated with invasive disease. MLST can be applied to almost all bacterial species and other haploid organisms, including those that are difficult to cultivate. The overwhelming advantage of MLST over other molecular typing methods is that sequence data are truly portable between laboratories, permitting one expanding global database per species to be placed on a World-Wide Web site, thus enabling exchange of molecular typing data for global epidemiology via the Internet.",

The increasing availability of whole genome sequence (WGS) data from Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates, however, provides us with an opportunity in which WGS can be mined for AMR determinants. Chromosomal and plasmid genes implicated in AMR were catalogued on the PubMLST Neisseria database (http://pubmlst.org/neisseria). AMR genotypes were identified in WGS from 289 gonococci for which MICs against several antimicrobial compounds had been determined. Whole genome comparisons were undertaken using whole genome MLST (wgMLST). Clusters of isolates with distinct AMR genotypes were apparent following wgMLST analysis consistent with the occurrence of genome wide genetic variation. This included the presence of the gonococcal genetic island (GGI), a type 4 secretion system shown to increase recombination and for which possession was significantly associated with AMR to multiple antimicrobials. Evolution of the gonococcal genome occurs in response to antimicrobial selective pressure resulting in the formation of distinct N. gonorrhoeae populations evidenced by the wgMLST clusters seen here. Genomic islands offer selective advantages to host bacteria and possession of the GGI may, not only facilitate the spread of AMR in gonococcal populations, but may also confer fitness advantages.",

Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are candidates in the search for comprehensive meningococcal vaccines; however, the formulation of OMP vaccines is complicated by antigenic diversity, which is generated by high levels of genetic reassortment and strong positive selection in the meningococcal antigen genes. The genetic and antigenic diversity of three OMPs (FetA, PorA, and PorB) among a global collection of meningococcal isolates representative of the major hyperinvasive clonal complexes was determined. There was evidence for antigenic structuring among the three OMPs that could not be explained purely by descent. These observations violated the predictions of the clonal and epidemic clonal models of population structure but were in concordance with models of strain structure which propose that host immunity selects for nonoverlapping antigen combinations. The patterns of antigenic variant combinations suggested that an OMP-based vaccine with as few as six PorA and five FetA variant sequences could generate homologous immune responses against all 78 isolates examined.",

        "abstract": "The genus Neisseria comprises a number of closely related Gram-negative organisms isolated from humans and animals. Their interrelationships are poorly resolved by phenotypic approaches, and the classification of the species groups by molecular techniques has been confused by a combination of their genetic similarity and extensive shared sequence polymorphism as a consequence of shared ancestry, horizontal genetic exchange, or both. Whole genome sequence analysis, especially of large numbers of draft genome sequences, has enabled the comparison of core genes across the genus, and this has proved to be an effective means of defining species groups within the genus. This redefinition is largely consistent with previous species designations with relatively few adjustments necessary. Most members of the genus are not, or are very rarely, pathogenic, but the genus contains the globally significant pathogens Neisseria meningitidis, the meningococcus, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the gonococcus. The meningococcus is an “accidental pathogen”: predominantly existing as a harmless commensal, with very few infections resulting in pathology. Pathology does not appear to play a role in the transmission of this organism, although some genotypes have a greater propensity to cause disease than others. The majority of work on the genus concentrates on the two pathogenic species, with attempts to develop a comprehensive vaccine against the meningococcus a major driver for research. The gonococcus is antigenically highly diverse but genetically quite uniform, and probably emerged from a single clone that changed its niche. Emerging antibiotic resistance of the gonococcus currently represents the most significant global health challenge presented by this genus.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Many host-adapted bacterial pathogens contain DNA methyltransferases (mod genes) that are subject to phase-variable expression (high-frequency reversible ON/OFF switching of gene expression). In Haemophilus influenzae, the random switching of the modA gene controls expression of a phase-variable regulon of genes (a “phasevarion”), via differential methylation of the genome in the modA ON and OFF states. Phase-variable mod genes are also present in Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, suggesting that phasevarions may occur in these important human pathogens. Phylogenetic studies on phase-variable mod genes associated with type III restriction modification (R-M) systems revealed that these organisms have two distinct mod genes—modA and modB. There are also distinct alleles of modA (abundant: modA11, 12, 13; minor: modA4, 15, 18) and modB (modB1, 2). These alleles differ only in their DNA recognition domain. ModA11 was only found in N. meningitidis and modA13 only in N. gonorrhoeae. The recognition site for the modA13 methyltransferase in N. gonorrhoeae strain FA1090 was identified as 5′-AGAAA-3′. Mutant strains lacking the modA11, 12 or 13 genes were made in N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae and their phenotype analyzed in comparison to a corresponding mod ON wild-type strain. Microarray analysis revealed that in all three modA alleles multiple genes were either upregulated or downregulated, some of which were virulence-associated. For example, in N. meningitidis MC58 (modA11), differentially expressed genes included those encoding the candidate vaccine antigens lactoferrin binding proteins A and B. Functional studies using N. gonorrhoeae FA1090 and the clinical isolate O1G1370 confirmed that modA13 ON and OFF strains have distinct phenotypes in antimicrobial resistance, in a primary human cervical epithelial cell model of infection, and in biofilm formation. This study, in conjunction with our previous work in H. influenzae, indicates that phasevarions may be a common strategy used by host-adapted bacterial pathogens to randomly switch between “differentiated” cell types.",

        "abstract": "Wild geese are a potential source of Campylobacter infection for humans and farm animals and have been implicated in at least two large waterborne disease outbreaks. There have been few investigations into the population biology of Campylobacter in geese, carriage rates are reported to vary (0 to 100%), and no genetic characterization of isolates has been performed. Fecal samples collected from wild geese in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom, were culture positive for C. jejuni (50.2%) and C. coli (0.3%). The C. jejuni (n = 166) isolates were characterized by using multilocus sequence typing and were compared with isolates collected from free-range broiler chickens and wild starlings sampled at the same location. A total of 38 STs, six clonal complexes, and 23 flaA SVR nucleotide STs were identified. The ST-21 and ST-45 complexes (5.4% of isolates) were the only complexes to be identified among isolates from the geese and the other bird species sampled in the same location. These clonal complexes were also identified among human disease isolates collected in the same health care region. The results indicate that large numbers of wild geese carry Campylobacter; however, there was limited mixing of Campylobacter populations among the different sources examined, and the host source could be predicted with high probability from the allelic profile of a C. jejuni isolate. In conclusion, genotypes of C. jejuni isolated from geese are highly host specific, and a comparison with isolates from Oxfordshire cases of human disease revealed that while geese cannot be excluded as a source of infection for humans and farm animals, their contribution is likely to be minor.",

Here, we address this question with a study of nucleotide sequence data from 107 isolates of the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. Gene fragments from 12 house-keeping loci distributed around the meningococcal chromosome were analyzed, showing that (1) identical alleles are disseminated among genetically diverse isolates, with no evidence for linkage disequilibrium; (2) different loci give distinct and incongruent phylogenetic trees; and (3) allele sequences are incompatible with a bifurcating treelike phylogeny at all loci. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that meningococcal populations comprise organisms assembled from a common gene pool, with alleles and allele fragments spreading independently, together with the occasional importation of genetic material from other species. Further, they support the view that recombination is an important genetic mechanism in the generation new meningococcal clones and alleles. Consequently, for anything other than the short-term evolution of this species, a bifurcating treelike phylogeny is not an appropriate model.",

We find that most mutations that occur during nasopharyngeal carriage are transient indels within repetitive tracts of putative phase-variable loci associated with host-microbe interactions (pgl and lgt) and iron acquisition (fetA promotor and hpuA). Recurrent polymorphisms occurred in genes associated with energy metabolism (nuoN, rssA) and the CRISPR-associated cas1. A gene encoding a large hypothetical protein was often mutated in 27% of the subjects. In volunteers who were naturally co-colonised with meningococci, recombination altered allelic identity in N. lactamica to resemble meningococcal alleles, including loci associated with metabolism, outer membrane proteins and immune response activators.

The emergence of poultry-associated lineages has involved zoonotic transmission from humans to chickens but questions remain about the specific adaptations that promote proliferation of chicken pathogens. We characterized genetic variation in a population of genome-sequenced S. aureus isolates of poultry and human origin. Genealogical analysis identified a dominant poultry-associated sequence cluster within the CC5 clonal complex. Poultry and human CC5 isolates were significantly distinct from each other and more recombination events were detected in the poultry isolates. We identified 44 recombination events in 33 genes along the branch extending to the poultry-specific CC5 cluster, and 47 genes were found more often in CC5 poultry isolates compared with those from humans. Many of these gene sequences were common in chicken isolates from other clonal complexes suggesting horizontal gene transfer among poultry associated lineages. Consistent with functional predictions for putative poultry-associated genes, poultry isolates showed enhanced growth at 42 °C and greater erythrocyte lysis on chicken blood agar in comparison with human isolates. By combining phenotype information with evolutionary analyses of staphylococcal genomes, we provide evidence of adaptation, following a human-to-poultry host transition. This has important implications for the emergence and dissemination of new pathogenic clones associated with modern agriculture.",

The phage were dot blotted onto membrane filters, which were used as targets for hybridization of radiolabeled amplified class 1 outer membrane protein genes. Thus, the presence of many different subtype-specific epitopes could be investigated in one experiment. This technique was evaluated with a set of serological reference strains, mainly of serogroup B organisms, and provided an alternative, rapid, and comprehensive typing system that was capable of distinguishing known serosubtypes and also of defining currently untypeable strains independently of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or serological analysis. An additional advantage of this technique was that in the case of an unknown serosubtype (i.e., one that did not hybridize with any of the known samples), the DNA amplified from the original sample could be used to determine the nucleotide sequence of the novel serosubtype and to clone the corresponding variable region into bacteriophage M13. It may be possible to develop this procedure for the diagnostic detection and typing of meningococci directly from clinical samples even when culture is not possible because of antibiotic treatment of an acute case.",

        "abstract": "Reference and type strains of well-known bacteria have been a cornerstone of microbiology research for decades. The sharing of well-characterized isolates among laboratories has run in parallel with research efforts and enhanced the reproducibility of experiments, leading to a wealth of knowledge about trait variation in different species and the underlying genetics. Campylobacter jejuni strain NCTC 11168, deposited at the National Collection of Type Cultures in 1977, has been adopted widely as a reference strain by researchers worldwide and was the first Campylobacter for which the complete genome was published (in 2000). In this study, we collected 23 C . jejuni NCTC 11168 reference isolates from laboratories across the UK and compared variation in simple laboratory phenotypes with genetic variation in sequenced genomes. Putatively identical isolates, identified previously to have aberrant phenotypes, varied by up to 281 SNPs (in 15 genes) compared to the most recent reference strain. Isolates also display considerable phenotype variation in motility, morphology, growth at 37 °C, invasion of chicken and human cell lines, and susceptibility to ampicillin. This study provides evidence of ongoing evolutionary change among C. jejuni isolates as they are cultured in different laboratories and highlights the need for careful consideration of genetic variation within laboratory reference strains.

        "abstract": "Campylobacter fetus can be divided into the subspecies C. fetus subsp. fetus and C. fetus subsp. venerealis. C. fetus subsp. fetus causes sporadic infections in humans and abortion in cattle and sheep and has been isolated from a variety of sites in different hosts. C. fetus subsp. venerealis is host restricted, being isolated mainly from the genital tracts of cattle, and is the causative agent of bovine genital campylobacteriosis. Despite differences in niche preference, microbiological subspecies differentiation has proven difficult. Different typing methods divided C. fetus isolates into different subgroups, depending on the methods used. The relative value of these methods can be assessed by the evolutionary relationship of isolates belonging to the genus; therefore, we developed a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for C. fetus. This scheme was applied to 140 C. fetus isolates previously typed by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis. A total of 14 different sequence types (STs) were identified, and these exhibited low levels of inter-ST genetic diversity, with only 22 variable sites in 3,312 nucleotides. These MLST data indicate that C. fetus is genetically homogeneous compared to the homogeneity of other Campylobacter species. The two C. fetus subspecies were extremely closely related genetically, but ST-4 was associated only with C. fetus subsp. venerealis, which represents a “bovine” clone. The C. fetus subsp. fetus isolates studied were more diverse in terms of their STs, and the STs correlated with epidemiological relationships. Congruence was observed among C. fetus subspecies, sap type, and ST; therefore, MLST confirms that mammalian C. fetus is genetically stable, probably as result of the introduction of a single ancestral clone into a mammalian niche.",

        "abstract": "Serogroup B invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is increasing in China, but little is known about the causative meningococci. Here, IMD and carriage isolates in Shanghai characterised and the applicability of different vaccines assessed. Seven IMD epidemic periods have been observed in Shanghai since 1950, with 460 isolates collected including 169 from IMD and 291 from carriage. Analyses were divided according to the period of meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPV) introduction: (i) pre-MPV-A, 1965–1980; (ii) post-MPV-A, 1981–2008; and (iii) post-MPV-A + C, 2009–2016. Over this period, IMD incidence decreased from 55.4/100,000 to 0.71 then to 0.02, corresponding to successive changes in meningococcal type from serogroup A ST-5 complex (MenA:cc5) to MenC:cc4821, and finally MenB:cc4821. MenB IMD became predominant (63.2%) in the post-MPV-A + C period, and 50% of cases were caused by cc4821, with the highest incidence in infants (0.45/100,000) and a case-fatality rate of 9.5%. IMD was positively correlated with population carriage rates. Using the Bexsero Antigen Sequence Type (BAST) system, fewer than 25% of MenB isolates in the post-MPV-A + C period contained exact or predicted cross reactive matches to the vaccines Bexsero, Trumenba, or an outer membrane vesicle (OMV)-based vaccine, NonaMen. A unique IMD epidemiology was seen in China, changing periodically from epidemic to hyperepidemic and low-level endemic disease. At the time of writing, MenB IMD dominated IMD in Shanghai, with isolates potentially beyond coverage with licenced OMV- and protein-based MenB vaccines.",

By drawing on large, well-characterised collections of lactic acid bacteria, we examined L. acidophilus isolates spanning 92 years and including multiple strains in current commercial use. Analysis of the whole genome sequence data set (34 isolate genomes) demonstrated L. acidophilus was a low diversity, monophyletic species with commercial isolates essentially identical at the sequence level. Our results indicate that commercial use has domesticated L. acidophilus with genetically stable, invariant strains being consumed globally by the human population.",

        "abstract": "Population and evolutionary analyses of pathogenic bacteria are frequently hindered by sampling strategies that concentrate on isolates from patients with invasive disease. This is especially so for the gram-negative diplococcus Neisseria meningitidis, a cause of septicemia and meningitis worldwide. Meningococcal isolate collections almost exclusively comprise organisms originating from patients with invasive meningococcal disease, although this bacterium is a commensal inhabitant of the human nasopharynx and very rarely causes pathological effects. In the present study, molecular biology-based techniques were used to establish the genetic relationships of 156 meningococci isolated from healthy young adults in the Czech Republic during 1993. None of the individuals sampled had known links to patients with invasive disease. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) showed that the bacterial population was highly diverse, comprising 71 different sequence types (STs) which were assigned to 34 distinct complexes or lineages. Three previously identified hyperinvasive lineages were present: 26 isolates (17%) belonged to the ST-41 complex (lineage 3); 4 (2.6%) belonged to the ST-11 (electrophoretic type [ET-37]) complex, and 1 (0.6%) belonged to the ST-32 (ET-5) complex. The data were consistent with the view that most nucleotide sequence diversity resulted from the reassortment of alleles by horizontal genetic exchange.",

        "abstract": "Populations of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) are typically structured into groups of closely related organisms or lineages, but it is not clear whether they are maintained by selection or neutral processes. Here, we attempt to address this question by applying a machine learning technique to SP whole genomes. Our results indicate that lineages evolved through immune selection on the groEL chaperone protein. The groEL protein is part of the groESL operon and enables a large range of proteins to fold correctly within the physical environment of the nasopharynx, thereby explaining why lineage structure is so stable within SP despite high levels of genetic transfer. SP is also antigenically diverse, exhibiting a variety of distinct capsular serotypes. Associations exist between lineage and capsular serotype but these can be easily perturbed, such as by vaccination. Overall, our analyses indicate that the evolution of SP can be conceptualized as the rearrangement of modular functional units occurring on several different timescales under different pressures: some patterns have locked in early (such as the epistatic interactions between groESL and a constellation of other genes) and preserve the differentiation of lineages, while others (such as the associations between capsular serotype and lineage) remain in continuous flux.",

In this study, the prevalence and genetic diversity of Campylobacter colonizing a single free-range broiler breeder flock was investigated over the course of a year. The age of the flock was the most important factor in determining both the prevalence and diversity of Campylobacter over time. There was no correlation with season, temperature, the amount of rain and sunshine, or the dynamics of colonization amongst geographically and temporally matched broiler flocks. The higher prevalence rates coincided with the age at which broiler chickens are typically slaughtered, but then in the absence of bio-security or other intervention methods, and despite changes in flock management, the prevalence fell to significantly lower levels for the remainder of the study. The genetic diversity of Campylobacter increased as the flock aged, implying that genotypes were accumulated within the flock and may persist for a long time. A better understanding of the ecology of Campylobacter within commercial chicken flocks will allow the design of more effective farm-based interventions.",

Barriers may be essential such as adaptive incompatibility, or ecological, which is associated with the opportunities for recombination in the natural habitat. Campylobacter jejuni is a gut colonizer of numerous animal species and a major human enteric pathogen. We demonstrate that the two major generalist lineages of C. jejuni do not show evidence of recombination with each other in nature, despite having a high degree of host niche overlap and recombining extensively with specialist lineages. However, transformation experiments show that the generalist lineages readily recombine with one another in vitro. This suggests ecological rather than essential barriers to recombination, caused by a cryptic niche structure within the hosts.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "The pneumococcus is a leading pathogen infecting children and adults. Safe, effective vaccines exist, and they work by inducing antibodies to the polysaccharide capsule (unique for each serotype) that surrounds the cell; however, current vaccines are limited by the fact that only a few of the nearly 100 antigenically distinct serotypes are included in the formulations. Within the serotypes, serogroup 6 pneumococci are a frequent cause of serious disease and common colonizers of the nasopharynx in children. Serotype 6E was first reported in 2004 but was thought to be rare; however, we and others have detected serotype 6E among recent pneumococcal collections. Therefore, we analyzed a diverse data set of ∼1,000 serogroup 6 genomes, assessed the prevalence and distribution of serotype 6E, analyzed the genetic diversity among serogroup 6 pneumococci, and investigated whether pneumococcal conjugate vaccine-induced serotype 6A and 6B antibodies mediate the killing of serotype 6E pneumococci. We found that 43% of all genomes were of serotype 6E, and they were recovered worldwide from healthy children and patients of all ages with pneumococcal disease. Four genetic lineages, three of which were multidrug resistant, described ∼90% of the serotype 6E pneumococci. Serological assays demonstrated that vaccine-induced serotype 6B antibodies were able to elicit killing of serotype 6E pneumococci. We also revealed three major genetic clusters of serotype 6A capsular sequences, discovered a new hybrid 6C/6E serotype, and identified 44 examples of serotype switching. Therefore, while vaccines appear to offer protection against serotype 6E, genetic variants may reduce vaccine efficacy in the longer term because of the emergence of serotypes that can evade vaccine-induced immunity.",

        "abstract": "Colonization of the human nasopharynx is a feature of some species of Neisseria, and is a prerequisite of invasive meningococcal disease. The likelihood of colonization by Neisseria meningitidis varies widely between humans, and very few develop invasive disease. Explants of nasal mucosa derived from adult patients with non-allergic nasal obstruction were infected experimentally with Neisseria spp. At intervals over 18 h incubation, washed explants were homogenized, and viable bacteria were counted. To estimate bacterial invasion of mucosa, explants were exposed to 0·25% sodium taurocholate for 30 s prior to homogenization. N. meningitidis was recovered from the mucosa and the organism invaded and replicated within the tissue, in contrast to N. lactamica and N. animalis (n=9, P<0·008). N. meningitidis isolates of clones ET-5, ET-37 and lineage III were recovered from and invaded tissue, but strains of clones A4, A:subgroup I, A:subgroup III and A:subgroup IV-1 did not invade (n=6). To measure host variation, survival of N. meningitidis within nasal mucosa of 40 different human donors was measured. Intra-class correlation of replicates was 0·97, but the coefficient of variation of recovered viable counts was 1335% after 4 h and 77% after 18 h incubation. It is concluded that the distinctive colonization and disease potential of Neisseria spp. may be partly a consequence of their ability to invade and survive within human nasopharyngeal mucosa, but that this is influenced greatly by genetic or environmental factors operating on the host mucosa. This is consistent with the unpredictable epidemiology of meningococcal disease.",

        "abstract": "Between 1999 and 2004, the European Union Invasive Bacterial Infections Surveillance Network (EU-IBIS) received c . 50 000 reports of meningococcal disease from 27 participating countries. Analysis has demonstrated a major decline in the incidence of invasive disease in those countries that have introduced routine vaccination against serogroup C infection. The establishment of rapid reporting of W135 and B2a/B2b strains has been able to provide early reassurance that these strains are not emerging as major public health problems in Europe. Between September 2001 and February 2005, the EU-MenNet project offered further opportunities for enhancing this data resource. Collaborative projects included: improving the EU-IBIS website; reviewing case ascertainment in Europe; reviewing cost-effectiveness studies for meningococcal serogroup C conjugate (MCC) vaccination; international comparisons of MCC vaccine efficacy; and mathematical modelling studies. In addition, linking of data from the European Meningococcal Multi-locus Sequence Type Centre to epidemiological data was performed. Particular clonal complexes were found to be preferentially associated with certain serogroups. Case fatality was also found to vary with clonal complex, suggesting that genotype can be a marker for hypervirulence. The importance of close collaboration between networks of epidemiologists, microbiologists, and the wider scientific and public health community is demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "Human campylobacteriosis exhibits a distinctive seasonality in temperate regions. This paper aims to identify the origins of this seasonality. Clinical isolates [typed by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)] and epidemiological data were collected from Scotland. Young rural children were found to have an increased burden of disease in the late spring due to strains of non-chicken origin (e.g. ruminant and wild bird strains from environmental sources). In contrast the adult population had an extended summer peak associated with chicken strains. Travel abroad and UK mainland travel were associated with up to 17% and 18% of cases, respectively. International strains were associated with chicken, had a higher diversity than indigenous strains and a different spectrum of MLST types representative of these countries. Integrating empirical epidemiology and molecular subtyping can successfully elucidate the seasonal components of human campylobacteriosis. The findings will enable public health officials to focus strategies to reduce the disease burden.",

However, we still know little about how cooperative relationships with bacteria originate, and why they form in some host species but not others. Facultative symbionts that are beneficial, but not essential, provide unique insights into these processes. We use data from over a hundred aphid species to test if host life history is associated with the presence of facultative symbionts. We find that aphid species that have mutualistic associations with ants that protect them from natural enemies are less likely to carry symbionts that provide similar benefits. We also find one symbiont species occurs more frequently in unrelated aphid species that specialise on certain plant genera. In addition, aphid species that attack multiple plants often carry different symbiont complements. Our findings provide evidence of the ecological conditions that facilitate stable, mutually beneficial relationships between microbes and eukaryotic hosts.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the processes whereby diversity arises and is maintained in pathogen populations is pivotal for designing disease control interventions. A particular problem is the maintenance of strain structure in bacterial pathogen populations despite frequent genetic exchange. Although several theoretical frameworks have been put forward to explain this widespread phenomenon, few have focused on the role of genes encoding metabolic functions, despite an increasing recognition of their importance in pathogenesis and transmission. In this article, we review the literature for evidence of metabolic niches within the host and discuss theoretical frameworks which examine ecological interactions between metabolic genes. We contend that metabolic competition is an important phenomenon which contributes to the maintenance of population structure and diversity of many bacterial pathogens.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "For nearly 30 years, 16S rRNA gene sequencing has been a fundamental tool for identification and cataloguing of bacterial diversity, but the diversity at this locus lacks the resolution to distinguish closely related bacteria. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) established the utility of a portable, gene-by-gene approach to population analyses, using both allelic and nucleotide sequence data that catalogue variation at seven housekeeping loci; however, it did not provide sufficient discrimination to define all variants of all bacteria. Recent advances in high-throughput next-generation sequencing technologies have permitted whole-genome sequencing of a wide variety of bacterial species and facilitated the development of genome-wide expanded MLST schemes. This chapter describes a flexible, scalable and hierarchical gene-by-gene approach to bacterial classification and population analyses, based on the concept of seven-locus MLST. Furthermore, the approach is both backwards and forwards compatible since 16S rRNA and seven-locus MLST information can be extracted and compared with original Sanger sequence data and the databases employed can accommodate sequence data from any source. The gene-by-gene approach is detailed in a variety of analyses: (i) speciation of Neisseria using nucleotide sequence from a single ribosomal protein locus (rplF); (ii) utilisation of variation at the 53 ribosomal protein gene loci to accurately and unambiguously identify and differentiate among bacterial species; (iii) identification of core genes and their comparison within a bacterial population; and (iv) the use of whole-genome population analysis for high-resolution studies, for example, the identification of potential disease outbreaks.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Encapsulated Neisseria meningitidis expressing serogroups A, B, C, W-135, or Y remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally. This bacterium is, however, a common commensal inhabitant of the human nasopharynx that causes disease infrequently. Isolates obtained from healthy carriers are frequently unencapsulated and therefore essentially avirulent. The lack of capsule can be due to inactivation of capsule synthesis genes by a variety of genetic mechanisms, or the absence of capsule synthesis genes. Analysis of inactivation mechanisms was undertaken in a diverse but representative set of 166 acapsulate meningococci isolated from carriage that possessed capsule synthesis genes. Slipped strand mispairing in the siaA and siaD genes of the capsule synthesis locus was observed in 39 isolates. Insertion sequence (IS) elements (IS1016-like, IS1106 and IS1301) were responsible for the loss of encapsulation in 46 isolates. Irreversible gene silencing events (insertions, deletions, base exchanges) were found in 47 isolates. Two non-synonymous mutations were identified in close vicinity of the putative active site of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase encoded by the siaA gene. The mechanisms for loss of encapsulation were not associated with particular meningococcal genotypes. There was no evidence for successive gene silencing events in the capsule genes, suggesting that the irreversible inactivation events observed were the result of short-term, within-host evolution. These observations are consistent with the postulate that particular meningococcal clonal complexes are associated with possession of a capsule and that this association is important for transmission success.",

        "abstract": "Transferrin binding protein B (tbpB), an outer membrane lipoprotein, is required for the acquisition of iron from human transferrin. Two tbpB families have been documented in Neisseria meningitidis: an isotype I tbpB gene of 1.8 kb and an isotype II tbpB gene of 2.1 kb, the former expressed by meningococci in the disease-associated ST-11 clonal complex and the latter found among meningococci belonging to the hyper-invasive clonal complexes including ST-8, ST-18, ST-32, ST-41/44 as well as N. gonorrhoeae isolates. The origin of the isotype I tbpB gene is unknown, however several features in common with non-pathogenic Neisseria and the ST-11 clonal complex N. meningitidis isolate FAM18 have been documented leading to the hypothesis that the isotype I tbpB gene may also be shared between non-pathogenic Neisseria and ST-11 meningococci. As a result, the diversity of the tbpB gene was investigated in a defined collection of Neisseria species. Two families of isotype I tbpB were identified: family A containing conserved genes belonging to ST-11 meningococci, N. polysaccharea and N. lactamica isolates and family B including more diverse isotype I tbpB genes from N. sicca, N. mucosa, N. flava, N. subflava as well as N. cinerea, N. flavescens and N. polysaccharea isolates. Three isotype II tbpB families were identified with: family C containing diverse tbpB genes belonging to N. polysaccharea, N. lactamica, N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis isolates, family D including another subset of isotype II tbpB genes from N. lactamica isolates and family E solely composed of N. gonorrhoeae tbpB genes. This study reveals another instance of similarity between meningococci of the ST-11 clonal complex and non-pathogenic Neisseria with the origin of the isotype I tbpB gene resulting from a horizontal genetic transfer event occurring between these two populations.",

        "abstract": "Temporal and seasonal trends in Campylobacter genotypes causing human gastroenteritis were investigated in a 6-year study of 3,300 recent isolates from Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. Genotypes (sequence types [ST]) were defined using multilocus sequence typing and assigned to a clonal complex (a cluster of related strains that share four or more identical alleles with a previously defined central genotype). A previously undescribed clonal complex (ST-464) was identified which, together with ST-42, ST-45, and ST-52 complexes, showed increasing incidence. Concurrently, the incidence of ST-574, ST-607, and ST-658 complexes declined. The relative frequencies of three clonal complexes (ST-45, ST-283, and ST-42) peaked during summer and those of two (ST-353 and ST-403) peaked during winter. Nine clonal complexes (ST-22, ST-45, ST-48, ST-61, ST-257, ST-283, ST-403, ST-658, and ST-677) were significantly associated with ciprofloxacin sensitivity (P < 0.05). Seven clonal complexes (ST-49, ST-206, ST-354, ST-446, ST-460, ST-464, and ST-607) were associated with ciprofloxacin resistance (P < 0.05). Clonal complexes exhibited changing incidence and differences in seasonality and antibiotic resistance phenotype. These data also demonstrated that detailed surveillance at a single site captures information which reflects that observed nationally.",

        "abstract": "Separate proteins for proton-linked transport of D-xylose, L-arabinose, D-galactose, L-rhamnose and L-fucose into Escherichia coli are being studied. By cloning and sequencing the appropriate genes, the amino acid sequences of proteins for D-xylose/H+ symport (XylE), L-arabinose/H+ symport (AraE), and part of the protein for D-galactose/H+ symport (GalP) have been determined. These are homologous, with at least 28% identical amino acid residues conserved in the aligned sequences, although their primary sequences are not similar to those of other E. coli transport proteins for lactose, melibiose, or D-glucose. However, they are equally homologous to the passive D-glucose transport proteins from yeast, rat brain, rat adipocytes, human erythrocytes, human liver, and a human hepatoma cell line. The substrate specificity of GalP from E. coli is similar to that of the mammalian glucose transporters. Furthermore, the activities of GalP, AraE and the mammalian glucose transporters are all inhibited by cytochalasin B and N-ethylmaleimide. Conserved residues in the aligned sequences of the bacterial and mammalian transporters are identified, and the possible roles of some in sugar binding, cation binding, cytochalasin binding, and reaction with N-ethylmaleimide are discussed. Each protein is independently predicted to form 12 hydrophobic, membrane-spanning α-helices with a central hydrophilic segment, also comprised of α-helix. This unifying structural model of the sugar transporters shares features with other ion-linked transport proteins for citrate or tetracycline.",

        "abstract": "In response to epidemic levels of serogroup B meningococcal disease in Cuba during the 1980s, the VA-MENGOC-BC vaccine was developed and introduced into the National Infant Immunization Program in 1991. Since then the incidence of meningococcal disease in Cuba has returned to the low levels recorded before the epidemic. A total of 420 Neisseria meningitidis strains collected between 1983 and 2005 in Cuba were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). The set of strains comprised 167 isolated from disease cases and 253 obtained from healthy carriers. By MLST analysis, 63 sequence types (STs) were identified, and 32 of these were reported to be a new ST. The Cuban isolates were associated with 12 clonal complexes; and the most common were ST-32 (246 isolates), ST-53 (86 isolates), and ST-41/44 (36 isolates). This study also showed that the application of VA-MENGOC-BC, the Cuban serogroup B and C vaccine, reduced the frequency and diversity of hypervirulent clonal complexes ST-32 (vaccine serogroup B type-strain) and ST-41/44 and also affected other lineages. Lineages ST-8 and ST-11 were no longer found during the postvaccination period. The vaccine also affected the genetic composition of the carrier-associated meningococcal isolates. The number of carrier isolates belonging to hypervirulent lineages decreased significantly after vaccination, and ST-53, a sequence type common in carriers, became the predominant ST.",

In particular, the relationship between the Ct genome, plasmid and disease was investigated. WGS data from 157 Ct isolates deposited in the Chlamydiales pubMLST database (http://pubMLST.org/chlamydiales/) were annotated with 902 genes including the core and accessory genome. Plasmid associated genes were annotated and a plasmid MLST scheme was defined allowing plasmid sequence types to be determined. Plasmid allelic variation was investigated. Phylogenetic relationships were examined using the Genome Comparator tool available in pubMLST. Phylogenetic analyses identified four distinct Ct core genome clusters and six plasmid clusters, with a strong association between the chromosomal genotype and plasmid. This in turn was linked to ompA genovars and disease phenotype. Horizontal genetic transfer of plasmids was observed for three urogenital-associated isolates, which possessed plasmids more commonly found in isolates resulting from ocular infections. The pgp3 gene was identified as the most polymorphic plasmid gene and pgp4 was the most conserved. A strong association between chromosomal genome, plasmid type and disease was observed, consistent with previous studies. This suggests co-evolution of the Ct chromosome and their plasmids, but we confirmed that plasmid transfer can occur between isolates. These data provide a better understanding of the genetic diversity occurring across the Ct genome in association with the plasmid content.",

        "abstract": "Horizontal genetic exchange between Campylobacter species was investigated by an analysis of the Campylobacter multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) database, which contains nucleotide sequence data of seven housekeeping genes from isolates classified microbiologically as belonging to C. jejuni and C. coli. Phylogenetic trees for each locus resolved at least two distinct clusters, and in each case it was possible to assign a cluster of sequences as being typically C. jejuni or C. coli. In some cases additional distinct branches were present, which may represent sequences originating in other Campylobacter species. For 51 of the sequence types (STs) present in the data set the allele sequences at one or more of the seven MLST loci were disparate, in that they were inconsistent with the microbiological classification of the isolate from which they were derived. These data provided evidence for relatively common interspecies recombination. Mapping of the disparate alleles onto the C. jejuni genome sequence indicated that four of those STs exhibiting two or more disparate alleles were likely to have originated by multiple genetic exchanges. A further 12 STs that have multiple disparate alleles may have originated by single genetic exchanges, although linkage patterns suggested that many of the latter could have arisen as a result of multiple genetic events. Examination of isolation sources of genotypes exhibiting disparate alleles showed that chicken isolates were under represented and bovine and ovine isolates were over represented, possibly indicating that recombinant genotypes are more common in animal species in which both C. jejuni and C. coli occur.",

We evaluated a multiplex PCR algorithm for the detection of a variety of carriage strains in the meningitis belt. To further improve the sensitivity and specificity of the existing PCR assays, primers for gel-based PCR assays (sodC, H, Z) and primers/ probe for real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays (porA, cnl, sodC, H, E, Z) were modified or created using Primer Express software. Optimized multiplex PCR assays were tested on 247 well-characterised carriage isolates from six countries of the African meningitis belt. The PCR algorithm developed enabled the detection of N. meningitidis species using gelbased and real-time multiplex PCR targeting porA, sodC, cnl and characterization of capsule genes through sequential multiplex PCR assays for genogroups (A, W, X, then B, C, Y and finally H, E and Z). Targeting both porA and sodC genes together allowed the detection of meningococci with a sensitivity of 96% and 89% and a specificity of 78% and 67%, for qPCR and gel-based PCR respectively. The sensitivity and specificity ranges for capsular genogrouping of N. meningitidis are 67% - 100% and 98%-100% respectively for gel-based PCR and 90%-100% and 99%-100% for qPCR. We developed a PCR algorithm that allows simple, rapid and systematic detection and characterisation of most major and minor N. meningitidis capsular groups, including uncommon capsular groups (H, E, Z).",

Indeed, this is the natural habitat of Neisseria meningitidis, and no other reservoir is known to exist for this bacterium. As the process of causing disease does not contribute to person-to-person transmission of meningococci, it is most usefully characterized as an ‘accidental pathogen’ of humans; host invasion is a dysfunctional event for both the microbe and its host, from which neither gains any benefit [1] (Figure 2.1). Although the significance of the carrier state has been long recognized, it has become increasingly apparent that an understanding of carriage is crucial to an understanding of meningococcal disease and its prevention. Here we shall outline the important features of meningococcal carriage and its study, and their implications for understanding disease.",

        "abstract": "The meningococcal capsule is an important virulence determinant. Unencapsulated meningococci lacking capsule biosynthesis genes and containing the capsule null locus (cnl) are predominantly non-pathogenic. Rare cases of invasive meningococcal disease caused by cnl isolates belonging to sequence types (ST) and clonal complexes (cc) ST-845 (cc845), ST-198 (cc198), ST-192 (cc192) and ST-53 (cc53) have been documented. The clinical significance of these isolates however remains unclear. We identified four invasive cnl meningococci through laboratory-based surveillance in South Africa from 2003 through 2013, which we aimed to characterize using whole genome data. One isolate [NG: P1.7-2,30: F1-2: ST-53 (cc53)] contained cnl allele 12, and caused empyema in an adult male with bronchiectasis from tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus and a smoking history. Three isolates were NG: P1.18-11,42-2: FΔ: ST-192 (cc192) and contained cnl allele 2. One patient was an adolescent male with meningitis. The remaining two isolates were from recurrent disease episodes (8 months apart) in a male child with deficiency of the sixth complement component, and with the exception of two single nucleotide polymorphisms, contained identical core genomes. The ST-53 (cc53) isolate possessed alleles for NHBA peptide 191 and fHbp variant 2; whilst the ST-192 (cc192) isolates contained NHBA peptide 704 and fHbp variant 3. All four isolates lacked nadA. Comparison of the South African genomes to 61 additional cnl genomes on the PubMLST Neisseria database (http://pubmlst.org/neisseria/), determined that most putative virulence genes could be found in both invasive and carriage phenotypes. Although rare, invasive disease by cnl meningococci may be associated with host immunodeficiency and such patients may benefit from protein-based meningococcal vaccines.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Protein-conjugate capsular polysaccharide vaccines can potentially control invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by five (A, C, W, X, Y) of the six IMD-associated serogroups.  Concerns raised by immunological similarity of the serogroup B capsule to human neural cell carbohydrates, meant that ‘serogroup B substitute’ vaccines target more variable subcapsular protein antigens.  A successful approach using outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as major vaccine components had limited strain coverage. In 4CMenB (Bexsero ®), recombinant proteins have been added to ameliorate this problem. Scalable, portable, genomic techniques were used to investigate the Bexsero ® OMV protein diversity in meningococcal populations. Shotgun proteomics identified 461 proteins in the OMV, defining a complex proteome. Amino acid sequences for the 24 proteins most likely to be involved in cross-protective immune responses were catalogued within the PubMLST.org/neisseria database using a novel OMV peptide Typing (OMVT) scheme. Among these proteins there was variation in the extent of diversity and association with meningococcal lineages, identified as clonal complexes (ccs), ranging from the most conserved peptides (FbpA, NEISp0578, and putative periplasmic protein, NEISp1063) to the most diverse (TbpA, NEISp1690).  There were 1752 unique OMVTs identified amongst 2492/3506 isolates examined by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). These OMVTs were grouped into clusters (sharing ≥18 identical OMVT peptides), with 45.3% of isolates assigned to one of 27 OMVT clusters. OMVTs and OMVT clusters were strongly associated with cc, genogroup, and Bexsero ® antigen variants, demonstrating that combinations of OMV proteins exist in discrete, non-overlapping combinations associated with genogroup and Bexsero Antigen Sequence Type. This highly structured population of IMD-associated meningococci is consistent with strain structure models invoking host immune and/or metabolic selection. The OMVT scheme facilitates region-specific WGS investigation of meningococcal diversity and is an open-access, portable tool with applications for vaccine development, especially in the choice of antigen combinations, assessment and implementation.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "Single locus variants (SLVs) are bacterial sequence types that differ at only one of the seven canonical multilocus sequence typing (MLST) loci. Estimating the relative roles of recombination and point mutation in the generation of new alleles that lead to SLVs is helpful in understanding how organisms evolve. The relative rates of recombination and mutation for Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were estimated at seven different housekeeping loci from publically available MLST data. The probability of recombination generating a new allele that leads to an SLV is estimated to be roughly seven times more than that of mutation for C. jejuni, but for C. coli recombination and mutation were estimated to have a similar contribution to the generation of SLVs. The majority of nucleotide differences (98 % for C. jejuni and 85 % for C. coli) between strains that make up an SLV are attributable to recombination. These estimates are much larger than estimates of the relative rate of recombination to mutation calculated from more distantly related isolates using MLST data. One explanation for this is that purifying selection plays an important role in the evolution of Campylobacter. A simulation study was performed to test the performance of our method under a range of biologically realistic parameters. We found that our method performed well when the recombination tract length was longer than 3 kb. For situations in which recombination may occur with shorter tract lengths, our estimates are likely to be an underestimate of the ratio of recombination to mutation, and of the importance of recombination for creating diversity in closely related isolates. A parametric bootstrap method was applied to calculate the uncertainty of these estimates.",

Analyses compared pathogen population structure between areas, over time, and between clinical presentations. Pooled analysis was performed with published international datasets. Subtype association with virulence was not observed. UK sites had nearly identical C. jejuni populations. A clade formed by ST45 and ST283 clonal complexes showed a summer peak. This clade was common in a Finnish dataset but not in New Zealand and Australian collections, countries with less marked seasonality. The UK, New Zealand and Australian collections were otherwise similar. These findings map to known in-vitro differences of this clade.

Diploid sequence type 69 was the most common MLST strain type and the founder of the largest clonal cluster, and examples were found among isolates from all parts of the world. ABC types and geographical origins showed statistically significant variations among clades by univariate analysis of variance, but anatomical source and antifungal susceptibility data were not significantly associated. A separate analysis limited to European isolates, thereby minimizing geographical effects, showed significant differences in the proportions of isolates from blood, commensal carriage, and superficial infections among the five most populous clades. The proportion of isolates with low antifungal susceptibility was highest for MAT homozygous a/a types and then α/α types and was lowest for heterozygous a/α types. The tree of clades defined by MLST was not congruent with trees generated from the individual gene fragments sequenced, implying a separate evolutionary history for each fragment. Analysis of nucleic acid variation among loci and within loci supported recombination. Computational haplotype analysis showed a high frequency of recombination events, suggesting that isolates had mixed evolutionary histories resembling those of a sexually reproducing species.",

        "abstract": "Sequence-based typing is essential for understanding the epidemiology of Campylobacter infections, a major worldwide cause of bacterial gastroenteritis. We demonstrate the practical and rapid exploitation of whole-genome sequencing to provide routine definitive characterization of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli for clinical and public health purposes. Short-read data from 384 Campylobacter clinical isolates collected over 4 months in Oxford, United Kingdom, were assembled de novo. Contigs were deposited at the pubMLST.org/campylobacter website and automatically annotated for 1,667 loci. Typing and phylogenetic information was extracted and comparative analyses were performed for various subsets of loci, up to the level of the whole genome, using the Genome Comparator and Neighbor-net algorithms. The assembled sequences (for 379 isolates) were diverse and resembled collections from previous studies of human campylobacteriosis. Small subsets of very closely related isolates originated mainly from repeated sampling from the same patients and, in one case, likely laboratory contamination. Much of the within-patient variation occurred in phase-variable genes. Clinically and epidemiologically informative data can be extracted from whole-genome sequence data in real time with straightforward, publicly available tools. These analyses are highly scalable, are transparent, do not require closely related genome reference sequences, and provide improved resolution (i) among Campylobacter clonal complexes and (ii) between very closely related isolates. Additionally, these analyses rapidly differentiated unrelated isolates, allowing the detection of single-strain clusters. The approach is widely applicable to analyses of human bacterial pathogens in real time in clinical laboratories, with little specialist training required.",

Here, by combining modelling approaches with multilocus sequence data for the zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter, we investigated how ecological factors such as niche (host) separation relate to population structure. We analysed seven housekeeping genes from published C. jejuni and C. coli isolate collections from a range of food and wild animal sources as well as abiotic environments. By reconstructing genetic structure and the patterns of ancestry, we quantified C. jejuni host association, inferred ancestral populations, investigated genetic admixture in different hosts and determined the host origin of recombinant C. jejuni alleles found in hybrid C. coli lineages. Phylogenetically distinct C. jejuni lineages were associated with phylogenetically distinct wild birds. However, in the farm environment, phylogenetically distant host animals shared several C. jejuni lineages that could not be segregated according to host origin using these analyses. Furthermore, of the introgressed C. jejuni alleles found in C. coli lineages, 73% were attributed to genotypes associated with food animals. Our results are consistent with an evolutionary scenario where distinct Campylobacter lineages are associated with different host species but the ecological factors that maintain this are different in domestic animals such that phylogenetically distant animals can harbour closely related strains.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "The poor immunogenicity of the meningococcal serogroup B (MenB) capsule has led to the development of vaccines targeting subcapsular antigens, in particular the immunodominant and diverse outer membrane porin, PorA. These vaccines are largely strain specific; however, they offer limited protection against the diverse MenB-associated diseases observed in many industrialized nations. To broaden the scope of its protection, the multicomponent vaccine (4CMenB) incorporates a PorA-containing outer membrane vesicle (OMV) alongside relatively conserved recombinant protein components, including factor H-binding protein (fHbp), Neisseria adhesin A (NadA), and neisserial heparin-binding antigen (NHBA). The expression of PorA is unique to meningococci (Neisseria meningitidis); however, many subcapsular antigens are shared with nonpathogenic members of the genus Neisseria that also inhabit the nasopharynx. These organisms may elicit cross-protective immunity against meningococci and/or occupy a niche that might otherwise accommodate pathogens. The potential for 4CMenB responses to impact such species (and vice versa) was investigated by determining the genetic distribution of the primary 4CMenB antigens among diverse members of the common childhood commensal, Neisseria lactamica. All the isolates possessed nhba but were devoid of fhbp and nadA. The nhba alleles were mainly distinct from but closely related to those observed among a representative panel of invasive MenB isolates from the same broad geographic region. We made similar findings for the immunogenic typing antigen, FetA, which constitutes a major part of the 4CMenB OMV. Thus, 4CMenB vaccine responses may impact or be impacted by nasopharyngeal carriage of commensal neisseriae. This highlights an area for further research and surveillance should the vaccine be routinely implemented.",

        "organization": "Professor of Molecular Epidemiology University of Oxford",
        "abstract": "The spread of antibiotic resistance within and between different bacterial populations is a major health problem on a global scale. The identification of genetic transformation in genomic data from Neisseria meningitidis, the meningococcus (Mc), and other bacteria is problematic, since similar or even identical alleles may be involved. A particular challenge in naturally transformable bacteria generally is to distinguish between common ancestry and true recombined sites in sampled genome sequences. Furthermore, the identification of recombination following experimental transformation of homologous alleles requires identifiable differences between donor and recipient, which in itself influences the propensity for homologous recombination (HR). This study identifies the distribution of HR events following intraspecies and interspecies Mc transformations of rpoB alleles encoding rifampicin resistance by whole-genome DNA sequencing and single nucleotide variant analysis. The HR events analysed were confined to the genomic region surrounding the single nucleotide genetic marker used for selection. An exponential length distribution of these recombined events was found, ranging from a few nucleotides to about 72 kb stretches. The lengths of imported sequences were on average found to be longer following experimental transformation of the recipient with genomic DNA from an intraspecies versus an interspecies donor (P<0.001). The recombination events were generally observed to be mosaic, with donor sequences interspersed with recipient sequence. Here, we present four models to explain these observations, by fragmentation of the transformed DNA, by interruptions of the recombination mechanism, by secondary recombination of endogenous self-DNA, or by repair/replication mechanisms.",

Paradoxically, the causative agent, Neisseria meningitidis, is a common inhabitant of the human nasopharynx, and as such, may be considered a normal, commensal organism. Only in a small proportion of colonized people do the bacteria invade the bloodstream, from where they can cross the blood–brain barrier to cause meningitis. Furthermore, most meningococcal disease is caused by bacteria belonging to only a few of the phylogenetic groups among the large number that constitute the population structure of this genetically variable organism. However, the genetic basis for the differences in pathogenic potential remains elusive. By performing whole genome comparisons of a large collection of meningococcal isolates of defined pathogenic potential we brought to light a meningococcal prophage present in disease-causing bacteria. The phage, of the filamentous family, excises from the chromosome and is secreted from the bacteria via the type IV pilin secretin. Therefore, this element, by spreading among the population, may promote the development of new epidemic clones of N. meningitidis that are capable of breaking the normal commensal relationship with humans and causing invasive disease.",

NadA has been identified in approximately 30% of clinical isolates and in a much lower proportion of carrier isolates. Three protein variants were originally identified in invasive meningococci and named NadA-1, NadA-2, and NadA-3, whereas most carrier isolates either lacked the gene or harbored a different variant, NadA-4. Further analysis of isolates belonging to the sequence type 213 (ST-213) clonal complex identified NadA-5, which was structurally similar to NadA-4, but more distantly related to NadA-1, -2, and -3. At the time of this writing, more than 89 distinct nadA allele sequences and 43 distinct peptides have been described. Here, we present a revised nomenclature system, taking into account the complete data set, which is compatible with previous classification schemes and is expandable. The main features of this new scheme include (i) the grouping of the previously named NadA-2 and NadA-3 variants into a single NadA-2/3 variant, (ii) the grouping of the previously assigned NadA-4 and NadA-5 variants into a single NadA-4/5 variant, (iii) the introduction of an additional variant (NadA-6), and (iv) the classification of the variants into two main groups, named groups I and II.

Theory and laboratory experiments suggest that bacteriocin production and immunity play a key role in the competitive dynamics of bacterial strains. The extent to which this is the case in natural populations, especially human pathogens, remains to be tested. We examined the role of bacteriocins in competition using Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains infecting lungs of humans with cystic fibrosis (CF). We assessed the ability of different strains to kill each other using phenotypic assays, and sequenced their genomes to determine what bacteriocins (pyocins) they carry. We found that (i) isolates from later infection stages inhibited earlier infecting strains less, but were more inhibited by pyocins produced by earlier infecting strains and carried fewer pyocin types; (ii) this difference between early and late infections appears to be caused by a difference in pyocin diversity between competing genotypes and not by loss of pyocin genes within a lineage over time; (iii) pyocin inhibition does not explain why certain strains outcompete others within lung infections; (iv) strains frequently carry the pyocin-killing gene, but not the immunity gene, suggesting resistance occurs via other unknown mechanisms. Our results show that, in contrast to patterns observed in experimental studies, pyocin production does not appear to have a major influence on strain competition during CF lung infections.",

        "abstract": "The opportunities for bacterial population genomics that are being realised by the application of parallel nucleotide sequencing require novel bioinformatics platforms. These must be capable of the storage, retrieval, and analysis of linked phenotypic and genotypic information in an accessible, scalable and computationally efficient manner. The Bacterial Isolate Genome Sequence Database (BIGSDB) is a scalable, open source, web-accessible database system that meets these needs, enabling phenotype and sequence data, which can range from a single sequence read to whole genome data, to be efficiently linked for a limitless number of bacterial specimens. The system builds on the widely used mlstdbNet software, developed for the storage and distribution of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data, and incorporates the capacity to define and identify any number of loci and genetic variants at those loci within the stored nucleotide sequences. These loci can be further organised into 'schemes' for isolate characterisation or for evolutionary or functional analyses. Isolates and loci can be indexed by multiple names and any number of alternative schemes can be accommodated, enabling cross-referencing of different studies and approaches. LIMS functionality of the software enables linkage to and organisation of laboratory samples. The data are easily linked to external databases and fine-grained authentication of access permits multiple users to participate in community annotation by setting up or contributing to different schemes within the database. Some of the applications of BIGSDB are illustrated with the genera Neisseria and Streptococcus. Genomic data can be used to characterise bacterial isolates in many different ways but it can also be efficiently exploited for evolutionary or functional studies. BIGSDB represents a freely available resource that will assist the broader community in the elucidation of the structure and function of bacteria by means of a population genomics approach.",

Analysis of WGS data identified a ‘Lineage 5 pan genome’ of 1940 genes, 1752 (92%) of which were present in all isolates (Lineage 5 ‘core genome’). Genetic diversity, which was mostly generated by horizontal gene transfer, was unevenly distributed in the genome; however, genealogical analysis of diverse and conserved core genes, accessory genes, and antigen encoding genes, robustly identified a star phylogeny with a number of sub-lineages. Most European and American isolates belonged to one of two closely related sub-lineages, which had diversified before the identification of the pandemic in the 1970s. A third, genetically more diverse sub-lineage, was associated with Asian isolates. Several isolates had acquired DNA from the related gonococcus. ",

Highly significant differentiation was seen at each housekeeping locus. A marked positive association of serogroup C with disease was evidenced.

A single ST dominated the ST-11 clone complex, while the ST-41/44 complex exhibited greater levels of diversity.

These interactions are thought to be of central importance in both the asymptomatic colonization of the nasopharynx and the sporadic occurrence of meningococcal disease. The receptor specificities of a limited number of Opa protein variants have been explored, but the high level of amino acid sequence diversity among variants has complicated the assignment of specific roles to individual Opa variants or combinations of variants. In addition, the distribution of Opa protein variants among diverse meningococci, information that is potentially informative for studies of Opa function, is poorly understood. A systematic survey of the genetic diversity in the four opa gene loci in each of 77 meningococcal isolates was undertaken. These isolates were representative of the seven hyperinvasive meningococcal clonal complexes that caused the majority of meningococcal disease over the last 50 years. Consistent with previous studies, a high level of sequence diversity was observed among the opa genes and the proteins that they encoded; however, particular sets of Opa protein variants were consistently associated with each of the clonal complexes over time periods often spanning decades and during global spread. These observations were consistent with the postulate that particular combinations of Opa proteins confer fitness advantages to individual clonal complexes and have implications for studies of Opa function and the inclusion of Opa proteins in novel meningococcal vaccines.",

The impact of this intervention on asymptomatic carriage of meningococci was investigated to establish whether serogroup replacement or protection by herd immunity occurred. Multicenter surveys of carriage were conducted during vaccine introduction and on 2 successive years, resulting in a total of 48,309 samples, from which 8599 meningococci were isolated and characterized by genotyping and phenotyping. A reduction in serogroup C carriage (rate ratio, 0.19) was observed that lasted at least 2 years with no evidence of serogroup replacement. Vaccine efficacy against carriage was 75%, and vaccination had a disproportionate impact on the carriage of sequence type (ST)-11 complex serogroup C meningococci that (rate ratio, 0.06); these meningococci also exhibited high rates of capsule expression. The impact of vaccination with MCC vaccine on the prevalence of carriage of group C meningococci was consistent with herd immunity. The high impact on the carriage of ST-11 complex serogroup C could be attributed to high levels of capsule expression. High vaccine efficacy against disease in young children, who were not protected long-term by the schedule initially used, is attributed to the high vaccine efficacy against carriage in older age groups.

The role of recombination relative to mutation in the generation of new MLST variants of V. vulnificus within the clusters is comparable to that of other highly recombining bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis. However, across the divide between the two major clusters of V. vulnificus strains, there is substantial linkage disequilibrium, lower estimates for recombination rates and shorter estimates of recombination tract length. We account for these differences between V. vulnificus and N. meningitidis by attributing them to the presence of the unusual genetic structure within V. vulnificus. The reason for the presence of distinct and divergent genomes remains unresolved. Two possible explanations put forward for future study are first, ecologically based population structure within V. vulnificus and second, a recombination donor from a phenotypically differentiated species.",
