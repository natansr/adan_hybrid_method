        "organization": "Academic Sessional",
        "abstract": "In contrast to global theories of the state, certain thinkers have followed Foucault in seeking to reflect upon the nature of government within 'modern' societies. Linked to this is the idea of the emergence of the social' as a specific domain of government and a specific sector of practices, interventions, and knowledges. I attempt to get at the strategic notion of the state and governance that emerges from Foucault and others. Also, I make an attempt to consider how we might think about this 'social' sector as it appears in phrases such as 'social policy' and 'social welfare'.",

Empirical evidence reveals that regular physical activity serves as a protective factor against many chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, including stroke, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. Physical activity is also important for reducing the risk of osteopenia (reduced bone mass), osteoporosis, and sarcopenia (reduced muscle mass) associated with aging (Wilmore, 2003). Moreover, daily exercise plays an important role",

In the words of the critic there are a number of limitations to the use of these concepts.

The present paper makes a modest attempt to examine whether there is any relationship between Patrimonialism and urban development.

        "abstract": "This paper, based on a survey of 523 people in the western region of Sydney (Australia), explores the responses of a cross-sectional sample in terms of what respondents considered to be complementary therapeutics, who is using them, and how often. The paper also explores in a limited way some of the reasons for using complementary therapeutics and, in particular, why some people had elected not to use complementary therapeutics. Although past studies have been limited by the absence of a sound theoretical base for the understanding of complementary therapeutics and their use, the findings lend support to a pluralist vis-â€¡-vis post- modernist explanation.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to report the cultural lifestyle factors of Asian Indians in Australia in relation to Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). This issue has not been previously explored in the Australian context. This study also seeks to identify factors that could inform health education and rehabilitation programs for migrant Asian Indians in Australia. The qualitative descriptive approach of constructivism was used for this study. Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with eight patients and five family members. Participants were at risk for coronary heart disease either due to unhealthy diet and/or lack of physical exercise and irregular health checks. Although lifestyle modifications were implemented by participants after the cardiac event, these changes were implemented inconsistently and without continuity. Knowledge of the beneficial effects of a healthy diet did not deter the participants from continuing to follow unhealthy dietary habits. The introduction of any exercise or physical activity by participants in this study lacked consistency. A positive aspect revealed from this study was the influence of culture and religious faith, which helped patients and family members to cope with the illness trajectory. The results of this study suggest that health education and rehabilitation programs need to be designed specifically for this high-risk group would be beneficial when initiated early in life and need to be targeted to the individual.",
