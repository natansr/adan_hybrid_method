        "organization": "Department of Physics Kyoto University",
        "abstract": "By combining a tilted-pulse-intensity-front scheme using a LiNbO3 crystal and a chirped-pulse-beating method, we generated a narrowband intense terahertz (THz) pulse, which had a maximum electric field of more than 10 kV/cm at around 2 THz, a bandwidth of ∼50 GHz, and frequency tunability from 0.5 to 2 THz. By performing THz-pump and near-infrared-probe experiments on GaAs quantum wells, we observed that the resonant excitation of the intraexcitonic 1s-2p transition induces a clear and large Autler-Townes splitting. Our time-resolved measurements show that the splitting energy observed in the rising edge region of electric field is larger than in the constant region. This result implies that the splitting energy depends on the time-averaged THz field over the excitonic dephasing time rather than that at the instant of the exciton creation by a probe pulse.",

A driving electric field, together with a stable phase that is associated with the optical probe pulses, enables the role of the dressed state in the optical response to be investigated. We observed optical absorption strengths modulated on a subcycle time scale in a GaAs quantum well in the presence of a multicycle terahertz driving pulse using a near-infrared probe pulse. The measurements were in good agreement with the analytical formula that accounts for the optical susceptibilities caused by the dressed state of the excitons, which indicates that the output probe intensity was coherently reshaped by the excitonic sideband emissions.",

With increasing THz electric field, optical susceptibility of the THz-dressed exciton shows a redshift with spectral broadening and extraordinary phase shift. This implies that the field ionization of the 1s exciton modifies the THz-dressed exciton in the nonperturbative regime.",

        "organization": "Department of Physics Kyoto University",
        "abstract": "In three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs), nontrivial topology in the bulk insulating state results in the surface electronic state that follows the massless Dirac equation with the spin state locked by the momentum direction. Properties in the ground state have been investigated with angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), tunneling spectroscopy and conductivity measurements. Optically excited Dirac fermions provide a useful platform for studying the non-equilibrium dynamics of relativistic particles interacting with electromagnetic field. Recently, their electric-field response such as the magneto-optical effect in the terahertz (THz) range has been studied with optical pump-probe measurements and time-resolved ARPES. Theoretically, spin-selective excitations by circularly polarized light are expected to induce an asymmetric distribution in the k-space and drive a macroscopic charge current, which has actually been observed by two-terminal sensing. However, the breaking of the symmetry due to the attachment of electrodes hinders clear understanding of the driving mechanism. Also, time-resolved techniques that are necessary for understanding the transient dynamics of the induced surface charge current have not been applied to these intriguing phenomena. Here we report our observation of THz emissions from an intrinsic TI material, Bi2−x2−xSbxxTe3−y3−ySeyy [(x,y)=(0.5,1.3)[(x,y)=(0.5,1.3) and (1,2)](1,2)], under the illumination of circularly polarized femtosecond pulses. The THz emission strongly depends on the helicity of the excitation pulses, indicating that its origin is the surface charge current. Nevertheless, we observed three-fold symmetry in the azimuthal-angle dependence, which cannot stem from the simple photogalvanic effect. A plausible origin of this charge current with unusual symmetry is the formation of Floquet-Bloch states on the surface.",

The magnetic field in the vicinity of the SRR induced by the incident THz electric field component excites and the Faraday rotation of the polarization of a near-infrared probe pulse directly measures oscillations that correspond to the antiferromagnetic spin resonance mode. The good agreement of the temperature-dependent magnetization dynamics with the calculation using the two-lattice Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation confirms that the spin wave is resonantly excited by the THz magnetic near-field enhanced at the LC resonance frequency of the SRR, which is 20 times stronger than the incident magnetic field.",

Using a THz microscope, we readapt a recent EO sampling scheme based on optical probe spectrum filtering. Combined with an ultra-thin EO crystal, we achieve record broadband video-rate THz near-field imaging. Particularly, this new scheme improves the THz bandwidth, the imaging contrast, and the spatial resolution. To validate our method, we show THz near-field images ranging from 100 GHz to 4 THz with a spatial resolution up to 𝜆/600λ/600 at 100 GHz. This demonstration positively affects the detection of intense THz pulses derived from the tilted-pulse-front excitation of lithium niobate and will accelerate our understanding of the interaction processes between electromagnetic waves and the conducting electrons of metallic interfaces.",

A spiral phase plate was used to generate a vortex beam with an OAM of ħ in the terahertz (THz) frequency region. We used THz near-field microscope to directly measure the phase vortex. A beam profile with a center dark spot and 2π phase rotation was observed in the small center gap region of the circular array antenna after the vortex beam excitation. The beam size is reduced by a factor of 3.4 ± 0.2. Half-wave resonance of the antenna element is responsible for the focusing function, indicating the scalability of this method to other frequency regions. This method will enable deep subwavelength focusing of light with OAM and eliminate the obstacle for the observation of the dipole forbidden transition with finite OAM of the vortex beam.",

We use ultrafast measurements with high-intensity terahertz pulses to show that IMI is significantly more efficient at lower than at higher initial carrier densities. Specifically, in the case of silicon with an intrinsic carrier concentration (∼1010 cm−3 ), the carrier multiplication process can generate more than 108 electrons from just a single free electron. The photoexcited carrier density dependence of the IMI rate shows that with decreasing initial carrier density the rate increases and approaches the fundamental Okuto limit imposed by energy conservation.",

        "abstract": "Recent development of ultra-short pulse technologies allows us to drive large amplitude motion of electron and ion coherently. The intense terahertz (THz) pulse resonant with the vibration frequency is promising to drive vibrations more directly and in coherent manner. In the case of semiconductors, one may coherently control the electronic system in the sub-level structures of quantum structures with intense THz waves. We recently performed the generation of intense terahertz pulse using tilted wave-front technique with a Ti:Sapphire regenerative amplifier [1]. Figure 1 shows typical time-profile of the electric field of the intense THz pulse: The maximum electric field is larger than 1 MV/cm (@1THz), which ponderomotive energy is as large as 10 eV. The ponderomotive energy is strong enough to ionize bound electronic states in solids such as donors and accepters and easy to induce nonlinear optical effects in solids",

Driving electric field, together with a stable phase that is associated with the optical probe pulses, enables the role of the dressed state in the optical response to be investigated. We observed optical absorption strengths modulated on a sub-cycle timescale in a GaAs quantum well in the presence of a multi-cycle terahertz driving pulse using a near-infrared probe pulse. The measurements were in good agreement with the analytical formula that accounts for the optical susceptibilities caused by the dressed state of excitons, which indicates that the output probe intensity was coherently reshaped by the excitonic sideband emissions.",

One of the most desirable nonlinear optical processes is high-harmonic generation (HHG) originating from coherent electron motion induced by an intense light field. Here, we report on the observation of up to ninth-order harmonics in graphene excited by mid-infrared laser pulses at room temperature. The HHG in graphene is enhanced by an elliptically polarized laser excitation, and the resultant harmonic radiation has a particular polarization. The observed ellipticity dependence is reproduced by a fully quantum mechanical treatment of HHG in solids. The zero-gap nature causes the unique properties of HHG in graphene, and our findings open up the possibility of investigating strong-field and ultrafast dynamics and nonlinear behavior of massless Dirac fermions.",

This article summarizes recent studies on THz nonlinear interactions with solid materials as follows. The tilted-pump-intensity-front scheme uses a LiNbO3 crystal to generate high-field single-cycle THz pulses with a 1 MV/cm amplitude. Such a high amplitude pulse can cause impact ionization in GaAs that excites electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, leading to exciton luminescence. A narrow-bandwidth THz pulse can be generated by using a chirped-pulse-beating method; this scheme has been used to show that resonant intraexcitonic excitation in GaAs induces a large Autler–Townes splitting. Moreover, nonlinear dynamics of magnetism can be studied by using a metallic split ring resonator to enhance the THz magnetic field.",

        "abstract": "Intense terahetz (THz) pulses induce a photoluminescence (PL) flash from undoped high-quality GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells under continuous wave laser excitation. The number of excitons increases 10000-fold from that of the steady state under only laser excitation. The THz electric field dependence and the relaxation dynamics of the PL flash intensity suggest that the strong electric field of the THz pulse ionizes impurity states during the one-picosecond period of the THz pulse and release carriers from a giant reservoir containing impurity states in the AlGaAs layers.",

The emergence of the light beam with transverse phase vortex, or equivalently orbital angular momentum (OAM) has been providing intriguing possibilities to induce unconventional optical transitions beyond the framework of the electric dipole interaction. The uniqueness stems from the OAM transfer from light to material, as demonstrated using the bound electron of a single trapped ion. However, many aspects of the vortex light-matter interaction are still unexplored especially in solids with extended electronic states. Here, we unambiguously visualized dipole-forbidden multipolar excitations in a solid-state electron system; spoof localized surface plasmon, selectively induced by the terahertz vortex beam. The results obey the selection rules governed by the conservation of the total angular momentum, which is numerically confirmed by the electromagnetic field analysis. Our results show light's OAM can be efficiently transferred to an elementary excitation in solids.",

A lot of work has been done to develop THz microscopes with high spatial resolution beyond the diffraction limit [2]. However, even if a spatial resolution below 10 μm was successfully achieved at THz frequency, the traditional schemes remain all based on raster scanning techniques [3,4], and typical measurement time takes more than 10 minutes to obtain a full image. Since samples are changing its conditions with time for biological applications, real-time acquisition is needed in addition to the high resolution.",

In quantum Hall systems, the thermal excitation of delocalized electrons is the main route to breaking bulk insulation2. In equilibrium, the only way to achieve a clear bulk gap is to use a high-quality crystal under high magnetic field at low temperature. However, bulk conduction could also be suppressed in a system driven out of equilibrium such that localized states in the Landau levels are selectively occupied. Here we report a transient suppression of bulk conduction induced by terahertz wave excitation between the Landau levels in a GaAs quantum Hall system. Strikingly, the Hall resistivity almost reaches the quantized value at a temperature where the exact quantization is normally disrupted by thermal fluctuations. The electron localization is realized by the long-range potential fluctuations, which are a unique and inherent feature of quantum Hall systems. Our results demonstrate a new means of effecting dynamical control of topology by manipulating bulk conduction using light.",

A new theoretical framework presented in this Letter holds the legitimacy of Bloch’s theorem even under the influence of the high-intensity electric field and provides an exact treatment of the diabatic processes of Bloch electrons. Utilizing this framework, we first discovered that the diabatic processes, namely, ac Zener tunneling and semimetallization of semiconductors, are key factors for nonperturbative mechanisms of HHG. These mechanisms are classified by the field intensity and could be understood by an extended simple man model based on an analogy between tunnel ionization in gaseous media and Zener tunneling in semiconductors. These conclusions would stimulate the universal understanding of HHG mechanisms in both atomic and solid cases.",

        "organization": "Department of Physics Kyoto University",
        "abstract": "Whether urea can serve as a kosmotrope or chaotrope has long been a topic of debate. In this study, broad-band THz spectroscopy (0.2–12 THz) of aqueous solutions of urea was used to characterize the hydration state and the hydrogen bond structure of water around urea. Three low-frequency vibration modes of urea were found around 2, 4, and above 12 THz. After eliminating the contribution of these modes, the “urea-vibration-free” complex dielectric constant was decomposed into the relaxation modes of bulk water and the oscillation modes of water. When hydration water is defined to be reorientationally retarded relative to bulk, our analysis revealed that the hydration number is 1.9 independent of urea concentrations up to 5 M, and this number is in close agreement with that of water constrained by strong acceptor hydrogen bonds of urea oxygen. Regarding the hydrogen bond structure, it was found that the tetrahedral-like water structure is mostly preserved (though the hydrogen bond lifetime is significantly shortened) but the population of non-hydrogen-bonded water molecules fragmented from the network is markedly increased, presumably due to urea’s NH2 inversion. These experimental results point to the coexistence of apparently two contradictory aspects of urea: dynamical retardation (the kosmotropic aspect) by the −CO group and slight structural disturbance (the chaotropic aspect) by the −NH2 group.",

        "abstract": "Metallic antenna arrays fabricated on high resistivity silicon are used to localize and enhance the incident THz field resulting in high electric field pulses with peak electric field strength reaching several MV/cm on the silicon surface near the antenna tips. In such high electric field strengths high density of carriers are generated in silicon through impact ionization process. The high density of generated carriers induces a change of refractive index in silicon. By measuring the change of reflectivity of tightly focused 800 nm light, the local density of free carriers near the antenna tips is measured. Using the NIR probing technique, we observed that the density of carriers increases by over 8 orders of magnitude in a time duration of approximately 500 fs with an incident THz pulse of peak electric field strength 700 kV/cm. This shows that a single impact ionization process is happening in a time duration of less than 20 fs. The measurement is repeated by exciting the sample with an optical pump beam at a wavelength of 400 nm. The optical pump sets the initial free carrier density before the THz-induced impact ionization. The measurements show that the carrier generation mechanism depends on the initial free carrier density which confirms that the carrier generation mechanism is impact ionization, rather than the alternative carrier generation mechanism in high electric field, i.e. Zener tunneling. Finally this technique can be extended to investigate carrier dynamics in other semiconductors.",

Given that THz waves may be generated and detected using ultra-short laser pulses, i.e. femtosecond (fs) laser, coherent time-domain THz measurement enable direct reading of the amplitude and phase information of the electric field. Combined with this capability, exploring the electromagnetic interactions of THz waves below diffraction limit is a powerful tool to understand the plasmonic nature of light at the metal/insulator interface. Here, we summarize on the recent advances in THz microscopy based on 2-dimensional electro optic (EO) imaging using an intense THz pulse source. These recent achievements in optimizing the spatial resolution and acquisition time will drastically accelerate our comprehension of the subwavelength light-matter interactions at THz frequencies and enable, among others, new sensing applications. Our discussion will include demonstrations on field enhancement in metallic-based resonators and potential avenues using THz vortex beam.",

In general, the interaction causes the formation of photon dressed state that is a quantum superposition state with energetically spaced sidebands and enables to generate the phase-locked sideband polarizations leading to unique optical responses. However, so far, the study is limited to the driving-cycle-averaged optical experiments [3,4], and thus, our understanding of the role of quantum phases in the optical response and their potential for electro-optic devices remains limited.",
