        "abstract": "We developed a model of hypoxic/asphyxic cardiac arrest in piglets to identify clinical responses that predict short-term outcome, testing the hypothesis that physiologic and electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities during and immediately after the hypoxic/asphyxic insult influence outcome. One-week-old piglets (N=22) were subjected to 30min hypoxia (FiO2=0.1), 5min room air, then 7min asphyxia, producing asphyxic cardiac arrest. Following cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), animals were survived 24-96hr for neurologic and neuropathologic evaluation. Animals in which CPR failed (6/22) had a lower PaO2 during hypoxia (19±0.6 vs 23±1mmHg), and earlier circulatory arrest during asphyxia (MAP < 25mmHg for 68±17 vs 251±41 sec). In survivors, neurologic function was measured by a novel neurologic deficit score (NDS) on a 0 (best) to 150 (worst) scale. High 24hr NDS correlated with low arterial pH at the end of hypoxia, a low arterial pH and a low serum glucose at 15min ROSC, and with a high degree of disproportional EEG frequency recovery during the first 4 hrs after ROSC. High 24hr NDS was associated with clinical seizures thereafter, and greater neocortical neuropathology at 96hrs. All non-surviving animals (4/10) died in status epilepticus and exhibited cerebral edema. We conclude that success of CPR is related to circulatory status and oxygenation during hypoxia and asphyxia. Neurologic status in survivors at 24 hrs is related to metabolic status at the end of hypoxia and early recovery and is predicted by EEG recovery, thus supporting the need for early interventions targeting metabolic status following hypoxia/asphyxia in newborns.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Neuronal apoptosis is induced prominently in the newborn rodent brain by glutamate receptor excitotoxicity and related insults, including trauma and hypoxia-ischemia. However, the molecular mechanisms of this neurodegeneration are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that changes in the subcellular distribution of the proapoptotic protein Bax precede the activation of downstream apoptosis-effector mechanisms such as caspase-3 cleavage and endonuclease activation during the progression of excitotoxic neuronal apoptosis in the striatum of newborn rat. Kainic acid (4 nmol) was injected into striatum of anesthetized 7-day-old rats, and the animals were killed at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h postinsult. Controls were age-matched, vehicle-injected, or naive rats. Counts of ultrastructurally confirmed striatal neuron apoptosis in brain sections were highest at 24 h. Striatal tissue was microdissected and fractionated into cytosolic, mitochondrial-, and nuclear-enriched compartments. Immunoblots showed that Bax translocates from the cytosol fraction to the mitochondrial fraction, with maximal translocation by 2 h in the absence of changes in mitochondrial accumulation. Cleaved caspase-3 levels increase progressively in both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions between 6 and 24 h. Cleaved caspase-3 accumulates in apoptotic striatal neurons as shown by immunolocalization. Internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA coincides with caspase-3 cleavage. We conclude that rapid translocation of Bax to mitochondria precedes caspase-3 and endonuclease activation during excitotoxic neuronal apoptosis in newborn rat brain and that initiation of this death cascade occurs within 2 h after glutamate receptor activation.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Glutamate transport is a primary mechanism for regulating extracellular levels of glutamate which can have either neurotrophic or neurotoxic effects in the developing brain, depending on its concentration. Using immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry, we tested the hypotheses that expression of neuronal and glial glutamate transporter proteins was regionally and temporally regulated in the developing ovine brain and that expression of the glial isoform early in development was not cell-type specific. Immunoblots for the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 revealed a major band of immunoreactivity at 69,000 mol. wt, whereas glial glutamate transporter-1 (GLT1) immunoreactivity was observed as 73,000 and 146,000 mol. wt proteins. EAAC1 and GLT1 are regulated differently during development, with EAAC1 immunoreactivity being most abundant at 60 and 71 days completed gestation (term=145 days) and dissipating thereafter, while GLT1 immunoreactivity was most abundant at 136 days gestation. By immunocytochemistry EAAC1 expression is neuronal throughout gestation with intense labelling of dendrites within the telencephalon evident at 60 days. Neuropil, neuronal cell bodies and processes are EAAC1-immunoreactive throughout gestation with no evidence of astrocytic or oligodendroglial immunoreactivity. In contrast, GLT1 is expressed by neuronal and non-neuronal cell types during midgestation with astrocyte selectivity developing by 136 days. During midgestation, GLT1 is transiently expressed in neurons of the subplate, cranial nerve nuclei, basal ganglia, and cerebellar cortex. The major finding of this study, that GLT1 is transiently expressed in various neuronal populations at midgestation demonstrates that the cell-type specificity of the GLT1 phenotype is developmentally regulated and depends on brain maturity.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that the neuropathologic outcome following recovery from incomplete ischemia is similar in normoglycemia and diabetes. Incomplete global ischemia was induced for 20 min in two groups of dogs: (a) normoglycemic, nondiabetic controls (n = 11) and (b) chronic (3 months), diabetic hyperglycemic subjects (n = 12). Animals were allowed to recover from surgery for 7 days after which they were perfusion-fixed for neuropathology. On paraffin processed tissue stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), ischemic neurons were counted and the per cent of cell damage determined. All control animals survived for 7 days postischemia. Four of 12 diabetic animals survived for 7 days, with the remaining eight diabetic dogs dying within the first 3 days. On day 7, the percentage of neurons showing ischemic cell change in the four diabetic survivors and the 11 nondiabetic controls was similar in the cerebellum, CA1, superior temporal gyrus, and caudate. However, diabetic dogs that did not survive the 7-day recovery period showed cerebellar swelling, reduced Purkinje cell densities, and herniation. During the 3 months prior to ischemia, morning (10.7 ± 4.4 versus 11.2 ± 5.2 mM) and afternoon (8.8 ± 5.0 versus 9.4 ± 5.3 mM) blood glucose levels in the four surviving and eight nonsurviving diabetic animals, respectively, were similar. However, preischemic blood glucose was significantly elevated in animals that did not survive (7.8 ± 2.8 versus 15.8 ± 7.3 mM in survivors and nonsurvivors, respectively). This study shows that diabetic animals surviving 7 days postischemia and nondiabetic controls have similar neuropathology. However, diabetic animals in which glucose control deteriorated during the 24-h prior to ischemia did not survive, possibly due to severe hindbrain edema. These results show that in diabetes, blood glucose control immediately prior to incomplete global brain ischemia is an important determinant of morbidity and neuropathology.",

        "abstract": "This study focuses on the morphometric changes of neurons in asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD), a state characterized by the presence of AD lesions in subjects without cognitive impairment. In autopsy brains, we used stereological methods to compare the cell body and nuclear volumes of anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) and CA1 hippocampal neurons in asymptomatic AD subjects (n = 9), subjects with AD dementia (AD, n = 8), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 9), and age-matched controls (controls, n = 9). In ACG, we observed a significant decrease in the neuronal volume of MCI and AD compared to controls; by contrast, no atrophy was present in asymptomatic AD. Moreover, we found a significant increase in nuclear volume in asymptomatic AD compared to controls (P < 0.001), MCI (P < 0.01) and AD (P < 0.001) brains. Similar results were found in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. This nuclear hypertrophy may represent an early neuronal reaction to Aβ or Tau, or a compensatory mechanism which forestalls the progression of AD and allows the brain to resist the development of dementia.",

In the majority of normal subjects, few or no β-amyloid (Aβ) deposits or senile plaques (SP) were present in the neocortex, but neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) were consistently found in CA1 of hippocampus and layer II of entorhinal cortex. In two (15%) normal individuals, the densities of SP were consistent with the diagnosis of possible Alzheimer's disease (AD). We speculate that these cases with normal cognitive states and abundant neocortical SP may represent preclinical AD. We conclude that the neocortex of a majority of cognitively intact individuals can remain free of Aβ deposits or SP, even into the tenth decade of life.",

        "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that basal ganglia (BG) structures show selective neuronal vulnerability and that AMPA receptor blockade protects cells within the glutamatergic corticostriatal pathways after asphyxie cardiac arrest in oneweek-old piglets. Anesthetized piglets were exposed to 30 rain of hypoxia followed by 7 min of airway occlusion. NBQX (n=10) or vehicle (n=10) was administered before airway occlusion (30 mg/kg, i.v.) and during the first 4 h of recovery (IS mg/kg/h). Four piglets in each group died in status epilepticus (usually at 24-48 h). Neuronal survival at 96 h was highly topographic in location. Number of viable neurons in caudate (C) was significantly higher than in putamen (P) (59±28 vs. 33±25; ±SD, p<0.001) or in substantia nigra pars reticulau (SNr) (<1%). Neuronal survival was not improved by NBQX in C (S7±24) or P (20±1756) compared to vehicle in C (62±33%) or P (46±32 ). Survival in P and SNr was less man in primary sensorimotor cortex with NBQX (45±28X) or vehicle (78±13%). When groups were pooled, occurrence of non-lethal seizure activity reduced neuronal survival in C (49±27 vs. 80±12%) and P (18±17 vs. 63±21%;p<0.02). We conclude that postatphyxic basal ganglia damage is highly selective in neonatal pigs and is distributed via cortical-subcortical pathways. Seizure activity worsened histopathology, possibly by excitotoxic corticostriatal activation, and AMPA receptor blockade failed to protect against neuronal damage within this pathway.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "The mechanisms of injury- and disease-related degeneration of motor neurons (MNs) need clarification. Unilateral avulsion of the sciatic nerve in the mouse induces apoptosis of spinal MNs that is p53 and Bax dependent. We tested the hypothesis that MN apoptosis is Fas death receptor dependent and triggered by nitric oxide (NO)- and superoxide-mediated damage to DNA. MNs in mice lacking functional Fas receptor and Fas ligand were protected from apoptosis. Fas protein levels and cleaved caspase-8 increased in MNs after injury. Fas upregulation was p53 dependent. MNs in mice deficient in neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) resisted apoptosis. After injury, MNs increased nNOS protein but decreased iNOS protein; however, iNOS contributed more than nNOS to basal and injury-induced levels of NADPH diaphorase activity in MNs. NO and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) fluorescence increased in injured MNs, as did nitrotyrosine staining of MNs. DNA damage, assessed as 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine and single-stranded DNA, accumulated within injured MNs and was attenuated by nNOS and iNOS deficiency. nNOS deficiency increased DNA repair protein oxoguanine DNA-glycosylase, whereas iNOS deficiency blocked diaphorase activity. MN apoptosis was blocked by the antioxidant Trolox and by overexpression of wild-type human superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1). In contrast, injured MNs in mice harboring mutant human SOD1 had upregulated Fas and iNOS, escalated DNA damage, and accelerated and increased MN degeneration and underwent necrosis instead of apoptosis. Thus, adult spinal MN apoptosis is mediated by upstream NO and ONOO- genotoxicity and downstream p53 and Fas activation and is shifted to necrosis by mutant SOD1.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) can result in significant sensorimotor abnormalities, including movement and posture disorders. These neurological impairments are believed to result from basal ganglia (striatum) damage, but the exact cause of this injury is not known. One mechanism involved in brain injury after HI is the generation of reactive oxygen species, which damage cellular macromolecules. We tested the hypothesis that inactivation of plasma membrane enzyme Na,K-ATPase during striatal neurodegeneration after HI emerges with peroxynitrite attack on the enzyme. In vitro, reaction of peroxynitrite (100–500 μM) with purified Na,K-ATPase produced nitration of the α (catalytic) and β (transport) subunits, as quantified by immunoblots of the reaction products for nitrotyrosine. To evaluate for peroxynitrite damage to Na,K-ATPase in vivo, striatal plasma membrane fractions from 1-week-old piglets subjected to asphyxic cardiac arrest and recovery were also studied by immunoprecipitation. During the progression of striatal neurodegeneration and loss of enzyme function 3–24 h after arrest, nitration of the α3 (neuronal) isoform of Na,K-ATPase was not increased relative to sham control. Suprisingly, however, nitration of this α isoform occurs during normal brain development and peaks at 2 weeks of age. We conclude that Na,K-ATPase is a target of peroxynitrite, but that this mechanism is not responsible for enzyme inactivation after HI. Protein nitration may serve as marker of other normal, noninjurious cell processes in the developing brain.",

        "abstract": "We developed a model of hypoxic/asphyxic cardiac arrest in piglets to study mechanisms and outcome.We tested the hypothesis that neurologic injury can be predicted by physiologic and electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities during and immediately after the hypoxic/asphyxic insult 1-wk old piglets(N=22)were subjected sequentially to 30 min hypoxia (10%FiO2), 5 min roomair, 7 min asphyxia. Standard CPR was performed until restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC, MAP>60mmHg). Animals were survived 24-96 hr for neuropathologic and neurologic outcome measures using a novel Neurologic Deficit Score (NDS) on a 0(best) to 150(worst) scale. Animals were assigned to good vs. poor outcome groups based on consciousness and behavior subscores at 24 hrs. EEG was recorded from awake baseline through 4 hrs ROSC. Quantitative EEG spectral analysis yielded an index of disproportional power recovery of dominant frequencies compared to the awake baseline (mean normalized separtion[MNS]). We observed that failure to acheive ROSC in 6/22 animals was associated with a lower PaO2 during hypoxia, and earlier circulatory arrest during asphyxia. In successfully resuscitated animals, high degrees of disproportional EEG frequency recovery (high MNS) during the first 4 hrs of recovery correlated with high 24-hr NDS. MNS at 45-220 min post-ROSC distinguished good vs. poor outcome groups at 24 hr recovery. High 24-hr NDS also correlated with low pH at the end of hypoxia, low pH at 15 min ROSC and low arterial glucose at 15 min ROSC. High 24-hr NDS was associated with seizures thereafter, and greater neocortical neuropathology at 96 hr. All non-surviving animals (4/10) died in status epilepticus and exhibited cerebral edema. We conclude this model closely resembles human neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. NDS provides a novel useful tool to distinguish moderate-to-severe levels of neurologic injury in piglets, and correlates with results of quantitative EEG analysis during early recovery. Success of CPR is related to circulatory status and oxygenation during hypoxia and asphyxia. Neurologic status in survivors at 24 hrs is related to metabolic status at the end of hypoxia and early recovery",

The present study in neonatal piglets examined the hypothesis that A2A receptor signaling after reoxygenation from global H-I contributes to injury in highly vulnerable striatal neurons where A2A receptors are enriched. A2A receptor immunoreactivity was detected in striatopallidal neurons. In nonischemic piglets, direct infusion of the selective A2A receptor agonist CGS 21680 through microdialysis probes into putamen increased phosphorylation of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor NR1 subunit and Na+, K+-ATPase selectively at protein kinase A (PKA)-sensitive sites. In ischemic piglets, posttreatment with SCH 58261, a selective A2A receptor antagonist, improved early neurologic recovery and preferentially protected striatopallidal neurons. SCH 58261 selectively inhibited the ischemia-induced phosphorylation of NR1, Na+, K+-ATPase, and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein 32 KDa (DARPP32) at PKA-sensitive sites at 3 hours of recovery and improved Na+, K+-ATPase activity. SCH 58261 also suppressed ischemia-induced protein nitration and oxidation. Thus, A2A receptor activation during reoxygenation contributes to the loss of a subpopulation of neonatal putamen neurons after H-I. Its toxic signaling may be related to DARPP32-dependent phosphorylation of PKA-sensitive sites on NR1 and Na+, K+-ATPase, thereby augmenting excitotoxicity-induced oxidative stress after reoxygenation.",

        "abstract": "We examined the effect of sodium fluoride on uptake of tritium- labeled T-2 toxin (molecules/cell) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and African green monkey kidney (VERO) cells. Correlations were made to temperature and toxin concentration over time. As expected, toxin uptake increased in both cell types with increasing time and temperature. Under all parameters, VERO cells exhibited significant increases in the rate of toxin uptake. The rate of equilibrium was affected by both temperature and sodium fluoride. Statistical analysis of individual time points along the curve demonstrated that sodium fluoride significantly increased cell-associated toxin at most time points. Analysis of the slopes of uptake curves from 0 to 20 min indicated significant (p0.05) differences in the rates of T-2 uptake in both cell types and toxin doses in the presence of sodium fluoride. The increase in toxin uptake in the presence of sodium fluoride was not due to altered cell membrane permeability caused by sodium fluoride. Difference in total uptake between cell types may reflect cell specific factors such as the number of intracellular binding sites. This study demonstrates that sodium fluoride significantly increases cell- associated T-2 toxin and the rate of toxin uptake in two cultured cell lines. Of the various actions of sodium fluoride, inhibition of ATP produced by glycolysis may be the most important. Sodium fluoride induced inhibition of glycolytic energy production may lead to increased cellular uptake of T-2, decreased cellular export of T-2, or a combination of both events.",

        "abstract": "Motor neuron degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a form of apoptosis, but the mechanisms for this neuronal cell death are not known. We evaluated whether motor neuron degeneration in ALS is associated with changes in the levels and function of the apoptosis regulating protein p53. The protein levels and localizations of p53 are abnormal in ALS. By immunoblotting, p53 is elevated in the nuclear compartment of selectively vulnerable CNS regions in individuals with ALS compared to age-matched controls. The levels of a carboxyl-terminal degradation fragment of p53 were decreased in cases of ALS. DNA binding assay demonstrated that the increased p53 in individuals with ALS had competent DNA binding activity. Immunocytochemistry revealed that in normal human CNS p53 is expressed in subsets of nonneuronal cells, but it is found only rarely in neurons; in contrast, in individuals with ALS, p53 is frequently found in motor neurons of spinal cord and motor cortex and is upregulated in astroglia. It is concluded that p53 may participate in the mechanisms for motor neuron apoptosis in ALS.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurological disorder in humans characterized by progressive degeneration of skeletal muscle and motor neurons in spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebral cortex causing skeletal muscle paralysis, respiratory insufficiency, and death. There are no cures or effective treatments for ALS. ALS can be inherited, but most cases are not associated with a family history of the disease. Mitochondria have been implicated in the pathogenesis but definitive proof of causal mechanisms is lacking. Identification of new clinically translatable disease mechanism-based molecular targets and small molecule drug candidates are needed for ALS patients. We tested the hypothesis in an animal model that drug modulation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is therapeutic in ALS. A prospective randomized placebo-controlled drug trial was done in a transgenic (tg) mouse model of ALS. We explored GNX-4728 as a therapeutic drug. GNX-4728 inhibits mPTP opening as evidenced by increased mitochondrial calcium retention capacity (CRC) both in vitro and in vivo. Chronic systemic treatment of G37R-human mutant superoxide dismutase-1 (hSOD1) tg mice with GNX-4728 resulted in major therapeutic benefits. GNX-4728 slowed disease progression and significantly improved motor function. The survival of ALS mice was increased significantly by GNX-4728 treatment as evidence by a nearly 2-fold extension of lifespan (360 days–750 days). GNX-4728 protected against motor neuron degeneration and mitochondrial degeneration, attenuated spinal cord inflammation, and preserved neuromuscular junction (NMJ) innervation in the diaphragm in ALS mice. This work demonstrates that a mPTP-acting drug has major disease-modifying efficacy in a preclinical mouse model of ALS and establishes mitochondrial calcium retention, and indirectly the mPTP, as targets for ALS drug development.",

        "abstract": "The olfactory bulb (OB) periventricular zone is an extension of the forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ) and thus is a source of neuroprogenitor cells and neural stem cells. While considerable information is available on the SVZ-OB neural stem cell (NSC)/neuroprogenitor cell (NPC) niche in rodents, less work has been done on this system in large animals. The newborn piglet is used as a preclinical translational model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage, but information about the endogenous sources of NSCs/NPCs in piglet is needed to implement endogenous or autologous cell-based therapies in this model. We characterized NSC/NPC niches in piglet forebrain and OB-SVZ using western blotting, histological, and cell culture methods. Immunoblotting revealed nestin, a NSC/NPC marker, in forebrain-SVZ and OB-SVZ in newborn piglet. Several progenitor or newborn neuron markers, including Dlx2, musashi, doublecortin, and polysialated neural cell adhesion molecule were also detected in OB-SVZ by immunoblotting. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the presence of nestin, musashi, and doublecortin in forebrain-SVZ and OB-SVZ. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling showed that the forebrain-SVZ and OB-SVZ accumulate newly replicated cells. BrdU-positive cells were immunolabeled for astroglial, oligodendroglial, and neuronal markers. A lateral migratory pathway for newly born neuron migration to primary olfactory cortex was revealed by BrdU labeling and co-labeling for doublecortin and class III β tubulin. Isolated and cultured forebrain-SVZ and OB-SVZ cells from newborn piglet had the capacity to generate numerous neurospheres. Single cell clonal analysis of neurospheres revealed the capacity for self-renewal and multipotency. Neurosphere-derived cells differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes and were amenable to permanent genetic tagging with lentivirus encoding green fluorescent protein. We conclude that the piglet OB-SVZ is a reservoir of NSCs and NPCs suitable to use in autologous cell therapy in preclinical models of neonatal/pediatric brain injury.",

The sub-lethal (0.5 LD50) dosage of soman produced RNA accumulation in NC neurons, but VTN-RNA levels were not significantly altered. In contrast, both reticular nuclei exhibited prominent RNA depletion with higher soman dosages, the severity of which was greater with lethal (1.5 LD50) than near-lethal (0.9 LD50) dosages. These data indicate that metabolic correlates of enhanced activation of cholinergic reticular nuclei are present only with sub-lethal dosages, and that higher dosages produce characteristics of impaired activation of ascending cholinergic pathways. At present, mechanisms underlying soman-induced metabolic and neurologic deficits remain speculative.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "We investigated the effects of 3-nitropropionic acid (3NPA), a previously characterized neurotoxin, in four strains of mice to better understand the molecular basis of variable host responses to this agent. Unexpectedly, we found significant cardiac toxicity that always accompanied the neurotoxicity in all strains of mice in acute and subacute/chronic toxicity testing. Caudate putamen infarction never occurred without cardiac toxicity. All mouse strains tested are sensitive to 3NPA although the C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice require more exposure than 129SVEMS and FVB/n mice. Cardiac toxicity alone was found in 50% of symptomatic mice tested and morphologically, the cardiac toxicity is characterized by diffuse swelling of cardiomyocytes and multifocal coagulative contraction band necrosis. In subacute to chronic exposure, atrial thrombosis, cardiac mineralization, cell loss, and fibrosis are combined with cardiomyocyte swelling and necrosis. Ultrastructurally, mitochondrial swelling occurs initially, followed by disruption of myofilaments. Biochemically, isolated heart mitochondria from the highly sensitive 129SVEMS mice have a significant reduction of succinate dehydrogenase activity, succinate oxygen consumption rates, and heart adenosine triphosphate after 3NPA treatment. The severity of morphological changes parallels the biochemical alterations caused by 3NPA, consistent with cardiac toxicity being a consequence of the effects of 3NPA on succinate dehydrogenase. These experiments show, for the first time, that 3NPA has important cardiotoxic effects as well as neurotoxic effects, and that cardiac toxicity possibly resulting from inhibition of the succinate dehydrogenase in heart mitochondria, contributes to the cause of death in 3NPA poisoning in acute and subacute/chronic studies in mice.",

Approximately 30% of hippocampopetal, 50–70% of amygdalopetal, and 50–90% of cingulopetal neurons were cholinergic; percentages varied among different regions of basal forebrain.

Adult rodent OB core cells have the capacities for self-renewal and multipotency and form neurospheres. The differentiation fates of these neurosphere-forming cells were studied in vitro and in vivo. Adult OB neurospheres were comprised of stem cells and neuronal and glial progenitor cells. OB neurospheres in co-culture with primary embryonic striatal neurons and cortical neurons generated cells with morphological and neurochemical phenotypes of striatal and cortical neurons, respectively. Transplanted OB cells, delivered as dissociated cells or as intact neurospheres, dispersed, survived for long-term, extended neurites, migrated, expressed neuronal or glial markers, and formed synapses with host neurons when placed into the environment of the nonlesioned and lesioned central nervous system (CNS). Grafted cells in the CNS also showed angiogenic capacity by forming blood vessels. In a model of spinal motor neuron degeneration, adult OB neurosphere cells transplanted into lesioned spinal cord adopted phenotypes of motor neurons and had a robust potential to become oligodendrocytes. OB core cells in co-culture with skeletal myoblasts generated skeletal muscle cells. Chimeric skeletal muscle was formed when mouse OB neurospheres were transplanted into rat skeletal muscle. Within skeletal muscle, adult OB neurosphere cells became myogenic progenitor cells to form myotubes de novo. We conclude that the adult mammalian OB is a source of pluripotent neural stem cells and progenitor cells that have the potential to become, in a context-dependent manner, specific types of cells for regeneration of tissues in brain, spinal cord, and muscle.",

        "abstract": "Studies were conducted to determine effects of the benzodiazepine anticonvulsant diazepam on soman induced brain neuronal RNA depletion and lethality in rats. Quantitative azure B-RNA cytophotometry was used to monitor RNA responses of cerebrocortical (layer V) and striatal neurons following dosages of 0.5, 0.9 and 1.5 LD50 soman (LD50 = 135 μg/kg, sc), whereas mean time of death and 24-h survival following 0.8, 1.2 and 1.5 LD50 were used to assess the antidotal efficacy of diazepam (2.2 mg/kg, im) pretreatment. Soman produced dose-dependent RNA depletion in both brain regions. This RNA impairment was almost completely prevented by diazepam, although neuronal RNA contents were generally slightly lower than corresponding control values. However, diazepam pretreatment was not associated with any change in mean time of death or in 24-h survival. The overall data suggest that excessive neural activity per se may underlie the genesis of soman-induced central metabolic impairments, but also appear to effectively dissociate epileptiform activity from lethal actions of soman.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "The implementation and clinical efficacy of hypothermia in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) encephalopathy are limited, in part, by the delay in instituting hypothermia and access to equipment. In a piglet model of HI, half of the neurons in putamen already showed ischemic cytopathology by 6 hours of recovery. We tested the hypothesis that treatment with the superoxide dismutase-catalase mimetic EUK-134 at 30 minutes of recovery provides additive neuronal protection when combined with one day of whole body hypothermia implemented 4 hours after resuscitation. Anesthetized piglets were subjected to 40 minutes of hypoxia (10% inspired oxygen) followed by 7 minutes of airway occlusion and resuscitation. Body temperature was maintained at 38.5°C in normothermic groups and at 34°C in hypothermic groups. All groups were mechanically ventilated, sedated, and received muscle relaxants during the first day of recovery. Neuropathology was assessed by profile and stereological cell counting methods. At 10 days of recovery, neuronal viability in putamen of a normothermic group treated with saline vehicle was reduced to 17±6% (±95% confidence interval) of the value in a sham-operated control group (100±15%). Intravenous infusion of EUK-134 (2.5 mg/kg at 30 minutes of recovery + 1.25 mg/kg/h until 4 hours of recovery) with normothermic recovery resulted in 40±12% viable neurons in putamen. Treatment with saline vehicle followed by delayed hypothermia resulted in partial protection (46±15%). Combining early EUK-134 treatment with delayed hypothermia also produced partial protection (47±18%) that was not significantly greater than single treatment with EUK-134 (confidence interval of difference: −15% to 29%) or delayed hypothermia (−16% to 19%). Furthermore, no additive neuroprotection was detected in caudate nucleus or parasagittal neocortex, where neuronal loss was less severe. We conclude that early treatment with this antioxidant does not substantially enhance the therapeutic benefit of delayed hypothermia in protecting highly vulnerable neurons in HI-insulted newborns, possibly because basal ganglia neurons are already undergoing irreversible cell death signaling by the time EUK-134 is administered or because this compound and hypothermia attenuate similar mechanisms of injury.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal adult-onset neurodegenerative disease that causes degeneration of motor neurons and paralysis. Approximately 20% of familial ALS cases have been linked to mutations in the copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene, but it is unclear how mutations in the protein result in motor neuron degeneration. Transgenic (tg) mice expressing mutated forms of human SOD1 (hSOD1) develop clinical and pathological features similar to those of ALS. We used tg mice expressing hSOD1-G93A, hSOD1-G37R, and hSOD1-wild-type to investigate a new subcellular pathology involving mutant hSOD1 protein prominently localizing to the nuclear compartment and disruption of the architecture of nuclear gems. We developed methods for extracting relatively pure cell nucleus fractions from mouse CNS tissues and demonstrate a low nuclear presence of endogenous SOD1 in mouse brain and spinal cord, but prominent nuclear accumulation of hSOD1-G93A, -G37R, and -wild-type in tg mice. The hSOD1 concentrated in the nuclei of spinal cord cells, particularly motor neurons, at a young age. The survival motor neuron protein (SMN) complex is disrupted in motor neuron nuclei before disease onset in hSOD1-G93A and -G37R mice; age-matched hSOD1-wild-type mice did not show SMN disruption despite a nuclear presence. Our data suggest new mechanisms involving hSOD1 accumulation in the cell nucleus and mutant hSOD1-specific perturbations in SMN localization with disruption of the nuclear SMN complex in ALS mice and suggest an overlap of pathogenic mechanisms with spinal muscular atrophy.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "The neuroprotective effect of hypothermia instituted after resuscitation from asphyxic cardiac arrest has not been studied in immature brain, particularly in a large animal model with recovery periods greater than 4 d. Moreover, protection from severe hypoxia seen with 3 h of hypothermia was reported to be lost when hypothermic duration was extended to 24 h in unsedated piglets, in contrast to the neuroprotection reported by 72 h of intrauterine head cooling in fetal sheep. Piglets (5–7 postnatal days) were subjected to asphyxic cardiac arrest followed by 24 h of either hypothermia (34°C) or normothermia (38.5–39°C). Comparisons were made with normothermic and hypothermic surgical sham animals without asphyxia. All of these groups were sedated, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated for the first 24 h to prevent shivering and possible depletion of glucose stores. Hypothermia per se did not cause remarkable structural abnormalities. Ischemic damage was evaluated in putamen at 1 d of recovery without rewarming and at 11 d (10 d ± SD after rewarming). Ischemic cytopathology affected 60 ± 12% of neurons in putamen of normothermic animals compared with 9 ± 6% in hypothermic animals at 1 d of recovery without rewarming. At 11 d of recovery from hypoxia-ischemia, the density of viable neurons (neuron profiles/mm2) in putamen was markedly reduced in normothermic animals (81 ± 40) compared with hypothermic animals (287 ± 22), which was the same as in sham normothermic (271 ± 21), sham hypothermic (288 ± 46) and naïve animals (307 ± 51). These data demonstrate that 24 h of hypothermia at 34°C with sedation and muscle relaxation after asphyxic cardiac arrest prevents necrotic striatal neuronal cell death in immature brain before rewarming, and that the effect is sustained at 11 d after injury without deleterious side effects.",

        "abstract": "Although the majority of Alzheimer's disease (AD) cases are sporadic, about 5% of cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern as familial AD (FAD) and manifest at an early age. Mutations in the presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene account for the majority of early-onset FAD. Here, we describe the generation of virus-free human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) derived from fibroblasts of patients harboring the FAD PSEN1 mutation A246E and fibroblasts from healthy age-matched controls using nonintegrating episomal vectors. We have differentiated these hiPSC lines to the neuronal lineage and demonstrated that hiPSC-derived neurons have mature phenotypic and physiological properties. Neurons from mutant hiPSC lines express PSEN1-A246E mutations themselves and show AD-like biochemical features, that is, amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) indicated by an increase in β-amyloid (Aβ)42/Aβ40 ratio. FAD hiPSCs harboring disease properties can be used as humanized models to test novel diagnostic methods and therapies and explore novel hypotheses for AD pathogenesis.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Two constitutively expressed isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) have been identified, Nos1 and Nos3. Nos1 was originally identified in neuronal cells and Nos3 in endothelial cells. Because the biochemical activity of NOS is developmentally regulated, we tested the hypothesis that protein expression is also developmentally regulated. Antibodies to Nos1 and Nos3 were evaluated for specificity by immunoblotting and then used for immunohistochemistry. In fetal and adult sheep brain homogenates, Nos1 antibodies identified one immunoreactive band of proteins at 155 kDa. The Nos3 antibody detected one immunoreactive band at 145 kDa that comigrated with a reactive band in endothelial cell lysates. Immunoblots of developing neocortex demonstrated that Nos1 was enriched at early gestational ages, whereas Nos3 expression was relatively constant throughout development. By immunohistochemistry, distinct isoform-specific patterns of immunoreactivity were detected. At 60 days, Nos1 immunoreactivity is primarily localized in neuropil, but by midgestation, nonpyramidal neurons are labeled in the cortical plate. Developing neurites are Nos1-positive at 60 and 71 days, decreasing in abundance by 93 days. By 93 days the striatum is fully populated by Nos1-expressing nonprincipal neurons. In hippocampus and subthalamic nucleus, Nos1 immunoreactivity is greatest at 60 and 71 days gestation, decreasing thereafter. Immunoreactivity for Nos3 delineates cerebrovasculature maturation from a primarily radial to a highly complex branching arrangement. Hindbrain structures achieve mature organization of the cerebrovasculature before forebrain. We conclude that constitutive NOS protein expression is developmentally regulated and that distinct isoforms of NOS are regulated differentially during brain development. Expression of Nos3 parallels maturation of the cerebrovasculature, whereas the transient, region- and cell type-dependent enrichment of Nos1 in the developing brain may indicate a temporally and spatially restricted role for this enzyme in the maturation of specific neuronal populations.",

        "abstract": "The cellular localization of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate glutamate receptor, GluR3, was identified using antibodies that recognize the N-terminus of the predicted polypeptide sequence of GluR3. Regional immunoblot analysis of monkey brain homogenates identified a protein of ∼102,000 mol. wt that was enriched in hypothalamus. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that GluR3 was enriched within the hypothalamic magnocellular neurosecretory nuclei and axons of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial tract in rat and monkey. GluR3 immunoreactivity co-localized to oxytocin-containing, but not vasopressin-containing, neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, supraoptic nucleus and accessory magnocellular nuclei. Ultrastructurally, GluR3 immunoreactivity was enriched throughout cytoplasm of the somatodendritic compartment and was associated with postsynaptic and presynaptic structures. GluR3 immunoreactivity was frequently observed to be clustered at the plasma membrane of the somatodendritic compartment, consistent with the predicted localization of a membrane-bound ion channel. Additionally, GluR3-immunoreactive axon terminals in synaptic contact with unlabeled dendrites within the retrochiasmatic area and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis were observed, providing morphological evidence for a presynaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor. By immunoblot analysis and immunocytochemistry using antibodies directed against a specific α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor in rat and monkey brain, our findings suggest a highly selective hypothalamic distribution of the GluR3 subunit that may have functional significance in the glutamatergic regulation of oxytocinergic neurons.",

Dose-dependent losses in neuronal RNA were observed within the cholinergic caudate-putamen (CP) and dopaminergic substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPC), whereas levels of RNA were generally maintained or elevated within the gabaergic substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNPR). CP acetylcholinesterase was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion. These neuronal RNA changes are perhaps related to seizure activity.

        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal adult human disease caused by motor neuron degeneration. Stem cell therapy might be a treatment for ALS. The adult mammalian forebrain has neural stem cells (NSCs) and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in the anterior subventricular zone (SVZa), rostral migratory stream (RMS), olfactory bulb (OB) core, and dentate gyrus (DG). These cells could be used to rescue or replace degenerating upper and lower motor neurons through endogenous recruitment or autologous/allogenic transplantation. We evaluated the competency of forebrain NSCs and NPCs in transgenic (tg) mice harboring human mutant superoxide dismutase‐1 (mSOD1), a model of ALS. Tg human wild‐type SOD1 (wtSOD1) mice and non‐tg mice were controls. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling of cells, a marker for cell proliferation and other events, was reduced in a niche‐specific pattern in presymptomatic and symptomatic mice, with the SVZa having greater reductions than the RMS, OB, and DG. Different NSC and NPC complements were evaluated by localizing nestin, neural cell adhesion molecule, distalless‐2 transcription factor, vimentin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. In symptomatic mice, NSC markers were reduced, whereas NPC markers were unchanged or elevated. Neurogenesis was preserved in symptomatic mSOD1 mice. NSC/NPC competence assessment in vitro revealed that mSOD1 SVZa cells had the ability to proliferate and form neurospheres but had an impaired response to mitogen stimulation. We conclude that adult mSOD1 ALS mice have abnormalities in forebrain NSCs, but the essential features of NSC/NPCs remained in presymptomatic and symptomatic mice",

        "abstract": "Neuronal death is normal during nervous system development but is abnormal in brain and spinal cord disease and injury. Apoptosis and necrosis are types of cell death. They are generally considered to be distinct forms of cell death. The re-emergence of apoptosis may contribute to the neuronal degeneration in chronic neurodegenerative disease, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, and in neurological injury such as cerebral ischemia and trauma. There is also mounting evidence supporting an apoptosis-necrosis cell death continuum. In this continuum, neuronal death can result from varying contributions of coexisting apoptotic and necrotic mechanisms; thus, some of the distinctions between apoptosis and necrosis are becoming blurred. Cell culture and animal model systems are revealing the mechanisms of cell death. Necrosis can result from acute oxidative stress. Apoptosis can be induced by cell surface receptor engagement, growth factor withdrawal, and DNA damage. Several families of proteins and specific biochemical signal-transduction pathways regulate cell death. Cell death signaling can involve plasma membrane death receptors, mitochondrial death proteins, proteases, kinases, and transcription factors. Players in the cell death and cell survival orchestra include Fas receptor, Bcl-2 and Bax (and their homologues), cytochrome c, caspases, p53, and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases. Some forms of cell death require gene activation, RNA synthesis, and protein synthesis, whereas others forms are transcriptionally-translationally-independent and are driven by posttranslational mechanisms such as protein phosphorylation and protein translocation. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of neuronal cell death in nervous system development, injury and disease can lead to new therapeutic approaches for the prevention of neurodegeneration and neurological disabilities and will expand the field of cell death biology.",

This cell preparation was used to measure the vulnerability of the MN genome to different reactive oxygen species (ROS). MN were exposed in vitro to hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide and peroxynitrite. Specific types of DNA lesions (e.g., abasic sites, single-strand breaks, and double-strand breaks) were measured using single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). The MN genome was very susceptible to attack by ROS. Different ROS induced different DNA damage profiles in MN. MN were also isolated from adult rats with sciatic nerve avulsions to show that DNA damage emerges early during their degeneration in vivo. This study demonstrates that the comet assay is a feasible method for profiling DNA lesions in the genome of single MN. Viable mature MN can be isolated and used for in vitro models of MN genotoxicity and can be isolated from in vivo models of MN degeneration for profiling DNA damage on a single-cell basis.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that the regional, cellular, and synaptic localizations of the glutamate receptor 1 (GluR1) subunit of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor are regulated developmentally in rat brain. By immunoblotting, GluR1 was first detected in whole brain at embryonic day E15.5, and levels increased progressively during late embryonic (E20) and early postnatal (P2–P11) days. Regionally, GluR1 increased in cerebral cortex but decreased in striatum with postnatal maturation. These changes occurred in the presence of increased presynaptic maturation, as determined by synaptophysin detection. By immunocytochemistry, distinct cellular populations showed different temporal profiles of GluR1 expression during postnatal maturation. The neocortex and hippocampus showed a progressive maturation-related enrichment of GluR1, whereas the striatum showed a gradual reduction in GluR1 during maturation. In cerebellum, GluR1 protein was expressed transiently at restricted times postnatally by granule cells (P0–P11) and Purkinje cells (P13–P19), but by P21 and thereafter these neurons had sparse GluR1 immunoreactivity. By immunoelectron microscopy, GluR1 was found in neurites, specifically in both dendritic and axon terminal components of developing synapses. GluR1 was clustered at the plasma membrane of apparent growth cone appositions, neuronal cell bodies, and dendrites of developing neurons. The presence of GluR1 at presynaptic sites dissipated with synaptic maturation, as GluR1 became confined to the somatodendritic compartment as maturation progressed. We conclude that the regional expression as well as the cellular and synaptic localizations of the GluR1 are developmentally regulated and are different in immature and mature brain. Differences in glutamate receptor expression and synaptic localization in immature and mature brain may be relevant to the phenomenon that the perinatal and adult brain differ in their regional vulnerability to hypoxia-ischemia and excitotoxicity.",

        "abstract": "We examined the postnatal ontogeny of the striatum in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) to identify temporal and spatial patterns of histological and chemical maturation. Our goal was to determine whether this forebrain structure is developmentally static or dynamic in postnatal life. Brains from monkeys at 1 day, 1, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months of age (N = 12) and adult monkeys (N = 4) were analyzed. Nissl staining was used to assess striatal volume, cytoarchitecture, and apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize and measure substance P (SP), leucine-enkephalin (LENK), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and calbindin D28 (CAL) immunoreactivities. Mature brain to body weight ratio was achieved at 4 months of age, and striatal volume increased from ~1.2 to ~1.4 cm3 during the first postnatal year. Nissl staining identified, prominently in the caudate nucleus, developmentally persistent discrete cell islands with neuronal densities greater than the surrounding striatal parenchyma (matrix). Losses in neuronal density were observed in island and matrix regions during maturation, and differential developmental programmed cell death was observed in islands and matrix regions. Immunohistochemistry revealed striking changes occurring postnatally in striatal chemical neuroanatomy. At birth, the immature dopaminergic nigrostriatal innervation was characterized by islands enriched in TH-immunoreactive puncta (putative terminals) in the neuropil; TH-enriched islands aligned completely with areas enriched in SP immunoreactivity but low in LENK immunoreactivity. These areas enriched in SP immunoreactivity but low in LENK immunoreactivity were identified as striosome and matrix areas, respectively, because CAL immunoreactivity clearly delineated these territories. SP, LENK, and CAL immunoreactivities appeared as positive neuronal cell bodies, processes, and puncta. The matrix compartment at birth contained relatively low TH-immunoreactive processes and few SP-positive neurons but was densely populated with LENK-immunoreactive neurons. The nucleus accumbens part of the ventral striatum also showed prominent differences in SP, LENK, and CAL immunoreactivities in shell and core territories. During 12 months of postnatal maturation salient changes occurred in neurotransmitter marker localization: TH-positive afferents densely innervated the matrix to exceed levels of immunoreactivity in the striosomes; SP immunoreactivity levels increased in the matrix; and LENK-immunoreactivity levels decreased in the matrix and increased in the striosomes. At 12 months of age, striatal chemoarchitecture was similar qualitatively to adult patterns, but quantitatively different in LENK and SP in caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. This study shows for the first time that the rhesus monkey striatum requires more than 12 months after birth to develop an adult-like pattern of chemical neuroanatomy and that principal neurons within striosomes and matrix have different developmental programs for neuropeptide expression. We conclude that postnatal maturation of the striatal mosaic in primates is not static but, rather, is a protracted and dynamic process that requires many synchronous and compartment-selective changes in afferent innervation and in the expression of genes that regulate neuronal phenotypes.",

        "abstract": "Quantitative azure B-RNA cytophotometry was used to monitor metabolic responses of individual neurons within the ventrobasal nuclear complex (VBC) and nucleus reticularis (NR) of the rat thalamus following administration of soman (0.5, 0.9 or 1.5 LD50, sc). A dose-dependent depression in brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was evidenced. With respect to thalamic RNA responses, a complex pattern of RNA alterations was evidenced, with these two regions generally exhibiting opposite patterns of dose-related RNA changes. With sub-lethal dosages of soman, RNA accumulation was evidenced in the acetylcholine (ACh) mediated excitatory VBC region and RNA depletion in the ACh mediated inhibitory NR neurons. With a lethal dose, an opposite RNA response pattern observed in both thalamic regions. It is postulated that the observed RNA response pattern with sub-lethal dosages of soman is what one would anticipate with cholinergic brainstem reticular formation activation. The absence of such a response with lethal doses strongly suggests some disruption of functional excitatory cholinergic activity and perhaps also an impairment of inhibitory cholinergic synaptic activity.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "We determined the neuropathologic damage in a canine model of global incomplete ischemia commonly used in a variety of physiological experiments. We induced 20 minutes of incomplete ischemia in dogs (n = 9) by increasing intracranial pressure via intraventricular infusion of artificial cerebrospinal fluid to maintain a cerebral perfusion pressure of 10 mm Hg while keeping body temperature at 38 degrees C during and immediately after ischemia. After a 7-day recovery period, animals were perfusion-fixed for neuropathology. In hematoxylin and eosin preparations, ischemic neuronal injury was assessed, neurons were counted, and percentage of cell damage was determined. No focal neurological deficits or overt seizures were observed during the 7-day recovery period. In superior temporal gyrus, 49 +/- 11% and 70 +/- 10% damage (mean +/- SEM) was observed in layer III pyramidal cells in the crown and sulcus, respectively. All neocortical regions examined showed neuronal damage in layers III and/or V. In hippocampus, 59 +/- 11% damage of pyramidal neurons occurred in CA1, with dorsal (septal) hippocampus showing more injury than ventral (temporal) portions. The caudate nucleus (head) exhibited 27 +/- 7% neuronal injury. In cerebellar cortex (anterior lobule), 70 +/- 7% damage of Purkinje cells occurred, but different folia of cerebellum showed varying degrees of injury. Brain stem and thalamus were minimally affected despite reduced blood flow. Inflammatory changes (leukocytic infiltration and neuronal incrustations) were observed, but only when neuronal degeneration was severe. Pancellular necrosis and infarction did not occur. This animal model of ischemia causes reproducible neuronal injury primarily in cortical regions without pancellular necrosis and infarction. Damage to subcortical areas is less severe than to cortical areas, despite comparable reductions in regional cerebral blood flow. Therefore, in the presence of regionally uniform but incomplete cerebral ischemia, neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal neurons and cerebellar cortical Purkinje cells are more likely than subcortical neurons to degenerate; alternatively, pyramidal and Purkinje neurons degenerate before neostriatal neurons in this model. This neuronal degeneration may represent an intrinsic cellular mechanism without major contribution of cytotoxic pathways associated with inflammation.",

        "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are the second and third most common human adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases, respectively, after Alzheimer's disease. They are characterized by prominent age-related neurodegeneration in selectively vulnerable neural systems. Some forms of PD and ALS are inherited, and genes causing these diseases have been identified. Morphological, biochemical, and genetic, as well as cell and animal model, studies reveal that mitochondria could have a role in this neurodegeneration. The functions and properties of mitochondria might render subsets of selectively vulnerable neurons intrinsically susceptible to cellular aging and stress and overlying genetic variations. In PD, mutations in putative mitochondrial proteins have been identified and mitochondrial DNA mutations have been found in neurons in the substantia nigra. In ALS, changes occur in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes and mitochondrial cell death proteins. Transgenic mouse models of human neurodegenerative disease are beginning to reveal possible principles governing the biology of selective neuronal vulnerability that implicate mitochondria and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. This review will present how mitochondrial pathobiology might contribute to neurodegeneration in PD and ALS and could serve as a target for drug therapy.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in newborns produces cerebral injury with potentially devastating long-term neurobehavioral consequences. In a model of global HI in newborn piglets there is a characteristic regional and temporal sequence of neurodegeneration. The basal ganglia show selective vulnerability that rapidly progresses in the first 24 hours after HI. A HI-induced increase of extracellular glutamate in the striatum may contribute to the excitotoxic cell injury. A family of glutamate transporters (GLT1, GLAST, and EAAC1) maintains physiological, non-excitotoxic extracellular glutamate concentrations. We hypothesized that defective glutamate transport in the striatum occurs early during recovery after HI in newborn piglets. One-week-old piglets were subjected to 30 minutes of hypoxia (arterial O2 saturation 30%), followed by 7 minutes of airway occlusion (arterial O2 saturation 5%), resulting in asphyxic cardiac arrest. Recovery for 3, 6, 12 or 24 hours followed cardiopulmonary resuscitation and return of spontaneous circulation. The corresponding percent of neurons with ischemic cytopathology in the putamen was 16%, 31%, 47%, and 79%. Synaptosomes were prepared from freshly frozen striatal samples. High-affinity [3H]-glutamate transport was 100%, 64%, and 52% of control levels at 3, 6/12, and 24 hours of recovery. HI did not alter either the affinity constant (Km) nor the number of transporter sites (Vmax) compared to control values. Therefore, defects in high-affinity glutamate uptake occur early and coincide with ongoing neurodegeneration in the striatum. Previous studies of type-specific glutamate transporter expression in newborn piglet striatum following HI have shown decreases in GLT1 and EAAC1 proteins, with no alteration in GLAST expression. We conclude that reduced high-affinity glutamate transporter function along with decreased GLT1 and EAAC1 expression may combine to create inadequate extracellular uptake, and thus provide a mechanism for early striatal excitotoxic neurodegeneration following HI in newborn piglets.",

        "abstract": "Studies suggest that protein kinase C (PKC) activation during ischemia plays an important role in glutamate neurotoxicity and that PKC inhibition may be neuroprotective. We tested the hypothesis that elevations in the biochemical activity and protein expression of Ca2+-dependent PKC isoforms occur in hippocampus and cerebellum during the period of delayed neurodegeneration after mild brain ischemia. We used a dog model of 20 minutes of global incomplete ischemia followed by either 6 hours, 1 day, or 7 days of recovery. Changes in PKC expression (Western blotting and immunocytochemistry) and biochemical activity were compared with neuropathology (percent ischemically damaged neurons) by means of hematoxylin and eosin staining. The percentage of ischemically damaged neurons increased from 13 +/- 4% to 52 +/- 10% in CA1 and 24 +/- 11% to 69 +/- 6% in cerebellar Purkinje cells from 1 to 7 days, respectively. The occurrence of neuronal injury was accompanied by sustained increases in PKC activity (240% and 211% of control in hippocampus and cerebellum, respectively) and increased protein phosphorylation as detected by proteins containing phosphoserine residues. By Western blotting, the membrane-enriched fraction showed postischemic changes in protein expression with increases of 146 +/- 64% of control in hippocampal PKC alpha and increases of 138 +/- 38% of control in cerebellar PKC alpha, but no changes in PKC beta and PKC gamma were observed. By immunocytochemistry, the neuropil of CA1 and CA4 in hippocampus and the radial glia in the molecular layer of cerebellum showed increased PKC alpha expression after ischemia. This study shows that during the period of progressive ischemic neurodegeneration there are regionally specific increases in PKC activity, isoform-specific increases in membrane-associated PKC, and elevated protein phosphorylation at serine sites.",

        "abstract": "Perinatal hypoxia-ischemia resulting in death or lifelong disabilities remains a major clinical disorder. Neonatal models of hypoxia-ischemia in rodents have enhanced our understanding of cellular mechanisms of neural injury in developing brain, but have limitations in simulating the range, accuracy, and physiology of clinical hypoxia-ischemia and the relevant systems neuropathology that contribute to the human brain injury pattern. Large animal models of perinatal hypoxia-ischemia, such as partial or complete asphyxia at the time of delivery of fetal monkeys, umbilical cord occlusion and cerebral hypoperfusion at different stages of gestation in fetal sheep, and severe hypoxia and hypoperfusion in newborn piglets, have largely overcome these limitations. In monkey, complete asphyxia produces preferential injury to cerebellum and primary sensory nuclei in brainstem and thalamus, whereas partial asphyxia produces preferential injury to somatosensory and motor cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus. Mid-gestational fetal sheep provide a valuable model for studying vulnerability of progenitor oligodendrocytes. Hypoxia followed by asphyxia in newborn piglets replicates the systems injury seen in term newborns. Efficacy of post-insult hypothermia in animal models led to the success of clinical trials in term human neonates.

        "abstract": "Birth asphyxia can cause moderate to severe brain injury. It is unclear to what degree apoptotic or necrotic mechanisms of cell death account for damage after neonatal hypoxia–ischemia (HI). In a 7-d-old rat HI model, we determined the contributions of apoptosis and necrosis to neuronal injury in adjacent Nissl-stained, hematoxylin and eosin-stained, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nick end-labeled sections. We found an apoptotic–necrotic continuum in the morphology of injured neurons in all regions examined. Eosinophilic necrotic neurons, typical in adult models, were rarely observed in neonatal HI. Electron microscopic analysis showed “classic” apoptotic and necrotic neurons and “hybrid” cells with intermediate characteristics. The time course of apoptotic injury varied regionally. In CA3, dentate gyrus, medial habenula, and laterodorsal thalamus, the density of apoptotic cells was highest at 24–72 hr after HI and then declined. In contrast, densities remained elevated from 12 hr to 7 d after HI in most cortical areas and in the basal ganglia. Temporal and regional patterns of neuronal death were compared with expression of caspase-3, a cysteine protease involved in the execution phase of apoptosis. Immunocytochemical and Western blot analyses showed increased caspase-3 expression in damaged hemispheres 24 hr to 7 d after HI. A p17 peptide fragment, which results from the proteolytic activation of the caspase-3 precursor, was detected in hippocampus, thalamus, and striatum but not in cerebral cortex. The continued expression of activated caspase-3 and the persistence of cells with an apoptotic morphology for days after HI suggests a prolonged role for apoptosis in neonatal hypoxic ischemic brain injury.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Extracellular glutamate concentrations are regulated by glial and neuronal transporter proteins. Four glutamate transporter subtypes have been identified in rat brain; GLAST and GLT-1 are primarily astrocytic, whereas EAAC1 and EAAT4 are neuronal. Using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry with subtype-specific antipeptide antibodies, we examined the protein expression and regional and cellular localization of each glutamate transporter subtype in embryonic and postnatal rat CNS. Each transporter had a specific pattern of expression. GLAST immunoreactivity was low prenatally but became enriched in cerebellar Bergmann glia early postnatally and then was also present in forebrain later postnatally. The post-translational modification of GLAST was unique among the subtypes; glycosylated GLAST increased with maturation, whereas nonglycosylated protein decreased in abundance postnatally. GLT-1 was present in fetal brain and spinal cord, with expression progressively increasing to adult levels throughout the neuraxis by postnatal day 26. Transient expression of GLT-1 immunoreactivity along axonal pathways was observed prenatally, in contrast to the exclusive localization of GLT-1 to astrocytes in the adult CNS. EAAC1, localized to neurons, was enriched in forebrain, diencephalon, and hindbrain during prenatal and postnatal development. EAAC1 expression was greater in newborn brain compared with adult brain. EAAT4 had a region-specific distribution; EAAT4 was mainly in cerebellum, localized to Purkinje cells, with much lower levels in forebrain. EAAT4 levels increased in cerebellum with age. We conclude that during CNS development the expression of glutamate transporter subtypes is differentially regulated, regionally segregated, and coordinated.",

This chapter briefly reviews the characteristics of PARP, its activation, and its role in both focal (stroke) and global (cardiac arrest/CPR) cerebral ischemia. We demonstrate PARP deficiency to be effective in reducing neuronal reperfusion injury after stroke and cardiac arrest/CPR in mouse models. These data suggest a selective role of PARP-1 in glutamate excitotoxicity and that strategies of inhibiting PARP-1 may offer substantial neuroprotection in focal and global cerebral ischemia.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Neuronal nucleic acid responses were examined within the rat thalamic ventro-basal nuclear complex (VBC) and nucleus reticularis (NR) following single intraperitoneal injections of the central muscarinic-cholinergic (M2) receptor agonist oxotremorine (0.1, 0.7, or 1.0 mg/kg). After stoichiometric azure B and Feulgen staining of brain sections, scanning-integrating cytophotometry was used to quantify azure B-ribonucleic acid (RNA) content, Feulgen-DNA levels, and changes in the susceptibility of chromatin to Feulgen acid hydrolysis (F-DNA yield) of neurons on an individual basis. Changes in neuronal nucleolar volume were also determined histometrically. Within the VBC, oxotremorine produced marked dose-dependent elevations in neuronal RNA content and nucleolar volume with increased F-DNA yield (chromatin activation) in a proportion of VBC neurons. In contrast, within the NR, oxotremorine elicited reductions in RNA levels, F-DNA yield and nucleolar volume. The data demonstrate that oxotremorine-induced central muscarinic receptor stimulation is associated with metabolic correlates of thalamic VBC neuroexcitation and NR neuron depression. The overall study lends further credence to the hypothesis that muscarinic-cholinergic mechanisms are operative within the mammalian thalamus.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal hypoxia–ischemia (HI) upregulates Fas death receptor expression in the brain, and alterations in expression and activity of Fas signaling intermediates occur in neonatal brain injury. B6.MRL-Tnfrsf6lpr mice lacking functional Fas death receptors are protected from HI brain damage in cortex, striatum, and thalamus compared to wild-type mice. Expression of Fas death receptor and active caspases increase in the cortex after HI. In wild-type mice, the hippocampus is most severely injured, and the hippocampus is the only region not protected in the B6.MRL-Tnfrsf6lpr mice. The selective vulnerability of the hippocampus to injury correlates with (1) lower basal expression of [Fas-associated death-domain-like IL-1β-converting enzyme]-inhibitory protein (FLIP), (2) increased degradation of spectrin to its 145 or 150 kDa breakdown product, and (3) a higher percentage of non-apoptotic cell death following neonatal HI. We conclude that Fas signaling via both extrinsic and intrinsic caspase cascades causes brain injury following neonatal HI in a region-dependent manner. Basal levels of endogenous decoy proteins may modulate the response to Fas death receptor signaling and provide a novel approach to understanding mechanisms of neonatal brain injury.",

        "abstract": "Effective therapies are needed for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a debilitating and fatal motor neuron disease. Cell and animal models of ALS are begsinning to reveal possible principles governing the biology of motor neuron-selective vulnerability that implicate mitochondria and the mitochondrial permeability pore (mPTP). Proteins associated with the mPTP are known to be enriched in motor neurons and the genetic deletion of a major regulator of the mPTP has robust effects in ALS transgenic mice, delaying disease onset and extending survival. Thus, the mPTP is a rational, mechanism-based target for the development of drugs designed to treat ALS. Trophos SA has discovered olesoxime (TRO-19622), a small-molecule with a cholesterol-like structure, which has remarkable neuroprotective properties for motor neurons in cell culture and in rodents. Olesoxime appears to act on mitochondria, possibly at the mPTP. Phase I clinical trials of olesoxime have been completed successfully. Olesoxime is well tolerated and achieves levels predicted to be clinically effective when administered orally. It has been granted orphan drug status for the treatment of ALS in the US and for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy in the EU. Phase II/III clinical trials are in progress in Europe.",

        "abstract": "We used silver staining to demonstrate neuronal cell body, axonal, and terminal degeneration in brains from p7 rat pups recovered for 0, 1.5, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72 h, and 6 days following hypoxia-ischemia. We found that initial injury is evident in ipsilateral forebrain by 3 h following hypoxia-ischemia, while injury in ventral basal thalamus develops at 24 h. A secondary phase of injury occurs at 48 h in ipsilateral cortex, but not until 6 days in basal ganglia. Initial injury in striatum and cortex is necrosis, but in thalamus the neurodegeneration is primarily apoptosis. Degeneration also occurs in bilateral white matter tracts, and in synaptic terminal fields associated with apoptosis in regions remote from the primary injury. These results show that hypoxia-ischemia in the developing brain causes both early and delayed neurodegeneration in specific systems in which the morphology of neuronal death is determined by time, region, and potentially by patterns of neuronal connectivity.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "The human neurodegenerative diseases, including motor neuron disease and Alzheimer's disease (AD), are characterized by a selective involvement of certain regions of the brain/spinal cord and selected populations of neurons. Sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an age-associated disease with cytoskeletal abnormalities and death of motor neurons; familial ALS (FALS), an autosomal dominant disease linked to mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), is manifested by inclusions and degeneration of motor neurons. Autosomal dominant familial AD (FAD), linked to mutations in presenilin (PS1 and PS2) genes or the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, shows brain abnormalities (e.g., neurofibrillary tangles, deposits of .-amyloid A., and death of subsets of neurons) similar to those that occur in sporadic AD, the risk of which is enhanced by the presence of one or two copies of apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) alleles. To examine the mechanisms of these diseases, investigators have used a variety of animal models, including experimentally produced, spontaneously occurring, or genetically engineered models of disease. Studies of models of degeneration of motor neurons (axotomy) and cytoskeletal abnormalities seen in motor neuron disease (i.e., axonopathy induced by .,.'-iminodipropionitrile (IDPN), hereditary canine spinal muscular atrophy (HCSMA), and neurofilament NF transgenic Tg mice) have demonstrated that NF-filled swellings of axons are related to alterations in the biology of NF transport. Tg mice with SOD1 mutations, which develop the clinical features of FALS, show selective degeneration of motor neurons, which is attributed to the acquisition of toxic properties by mutant SOD1. Models of AD include: aged monkeys that show both cognitive/memory deficits and cellular abnormalities (amyloid deposition/cytoskeletal abnormalities of neurons) in cortex and hippocampus; and Tg mice that express mutant human FAD-linked genes (i.e., APP and PS1) and show increased levels of A.42, amyloid deposits, dystrophic neurites, and local responses of astrocytes and microglia. This review discusses the behavioral/neuropathological features of AD, the results of investigations of mechanisms of disease in model systems, and potential utility of some of these models for testing new therapies.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Cerebral cortical neuron degeneration occurs in brain disorders manifesting throughout life, but the mechanisms are understood poorly. We used cultured embryonic mouse cortical neurons and an in vivo mouse model to study mechanisms of DNA damaged-induced apoptosis in immature and differentiated neurons. p53 drives apoptosis of immature and differentiated cortical neurons through its rapid and prominent activation stimulated by DNA strand breaks induced by topoisomerase-I and -II inhibition. Blocking p53-DNA transactivation with α-pifithrin protects immature neurons; blocking p53-mitochondrial functions with μ-pifithrin protects differentiated neurons. Mitochondrial death proteins are upregulated in apoptotic immature and differentiated neurons and have nonredundant proapoptotic functions; Bak is more dominant than Bax in differentiated neurons. p53 phosphorylation is mediated by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase. ATM inactivation is antiapoptotic, particularly in differentiated neurons, whereas inhibition of c-Abl protects immature neurons but not differentiated neurons. Cell death protein expression patterns in mouse forebrain are mostly similar to cultured neurons. DNA damage induces prominent p53 activation and apoptosis in cerebral cortex in vivo. Thus, DNA strand breaks in cortical neurons induce rapid p53-mediated apoptosis through actions of upstream ATM and c-Abl kinases and downstream mitochondrial death proteins. This molecular network operates through variations depending on neuron maturity.",

        "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that synaptic defects in the hippocampus of individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) correlate with the severity of cognitive impairment. Three postmortem groups were studied: controls with normal and stable cognition; cognitively intact subjects with senile plaque densities diagnostic for possible AD (p-AD) and neurofibrillary changes characteristic of early AD (Braak stage III); and individuals with definite AD and neurofibrillary changes typical of incipient to severe AD (Braak stage III, V, or VI). Synaptophysin (a presynaptic vesicle protein) levels were quantified by immunoblotting of synaptic membrane fractions isolated from hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, caudate nucleus, and occipital cortex. Average synaptophysin levels were reduced in hippocampus when comparing definite AD to controls (55%, p < 0.0001), p-AD to control (25%, p < 0.005), and definite AD to p-AD (30%, p < 0.05), but levels in entorhinal cortex, occipital cortex, and caudate nucleus were either unchanged or less significantly altered than in hippocampus. By univariate analysis, hippocampal synaptophysin levels correlated with neuropsychological measurements, including Mini-mental state examination scores (r = 0.83, p < 0.0001) and Blessed scores (r = 0.74, P < 0.001), and with senile plaque densities (r = 0.89, p < 0.0001). We conclude that synaptic abnormalities in the hippocampus correlate with the severity of neuropathology and memory deficit in individuals with AD, and that this defect may predate neuropsychological evidence for cognitive impairment early in AD.",

For example, in virtually every case, AD affects basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, which express receptors for nerve growth factor (NGF). Perikarya of many neurons in involved systems develop neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) (fibrillar intracytoplasmic inclusions) and abnormally enlarged distal axons/terminals (forming neurites that surround senile plaques). Amyloid, deposited in plaques and around blood vessels (congophilic angiopathy), is made up of a 4-kiloDalton (kD) β/A4 peptide, derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP).

        "abstract": "In neonates, asphyxia is a common cause of neuronal injury and often results in seizures. The authors evaluated whether blockade of a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors during asphyxia and early recovery with 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo-(F)-quinoxaline (NBQX) ameliorates neurologic deficit and histopathology in 1-week-old piglets. Anesthetized piglets were exposed to a sequence of 30 minutes of hypoxia, 5 minutes of room air ventilation, 7 minutes of airway occlusion, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Vehicle or NBQX was administered intravenously before asphyxia (30 mg/kg) and during the first 4 hours of recovery (15 mg/kg/h). Neuropathologic findings were evaluated at 96 hours of recovery by light microscopic and cytochrome oxidase histochemical study. Cardiac arrest occurred at 5 to 6 minutes of airway occlusion, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation restored spontaneous circulation independent of treatment modalities in about 2 to 3 minutes. Neurologic deficit over the 96-hour recovery period was not ameliorated by NBQX. Seizure activity began after 24 to 48 hours in 7 of 10 animals with vehicle and in 9 of 10 of animals with NBQX. In each group, four animals died in status epilepticus. Neuropathologic outcomes were not improved by NBQX. The density of remaining viable neurons was decreased in parietal cortex and putamen by NBQX treatment. Metabolic defects in cytochrome oxidase activity were worsened by NBQX treatment. Seizure activity during recovery was associated with reduced neuronal viability in neocortex and striatum in piglets from both groups that survived for 96 hours. This neonatal model of asphyxic cardiac arrest and resuscitation generates neurologic deficits, clinical seizure activity, and selective damage in regions of basal ganglia and sensorimotor cortex. In contrast to other studies in mature brain, AMPA receptor blockade with NBQX failed to protect against neurologic damage in the immature piglet and worsened postasphyxic histopathologic outcome in neocortex and putamen.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in newborns can cause brain damage and a variety of neurological abnormalities, including disorders in movement and posture. These motor disorders are thought to be due to damage to the basal ganglia after HI. The mechanisms for neuronal degeneration in the basal ganglia following HI in newborns are not understood. We used a piglet model of HI to test the hypothesis that defects in Na+,K+ ATPase occur during the progression of striatal neuron necrosis. Piglets (1 week old) were subjected to 30 minutes hypoxia (arterial oxygen saturation 30%) and then 7 minutes of airway occlusion (oxygen saturation 5%), producing asphyxic cardiac arrest, followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation, return of spontaneous circulation, and then recovery for 3, 6, 12 or 24 hours (h). In this model of HI, the vulnerability of the putamen is much greater than that of the caudate nucleus (Martin et al, J. Comp. Neurol. 377:262-285, 1997). Neuronal injury in putamen evolves progressively after HI, with 16%, 31%, 47%, and 79% of neurons damaged at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively. By the electron microscopy and DNA fragmentation analysis, this neuronal degeneration is structurally and biochemically cellular necrosis (Martin et al, Ann. Neurol. 42:355-348, 1997; Martin et al, Brain Res. Bull. 46:281-309, 1998). HI causes time-dependent changes in Na+,K+ ATPase function, as determined by biochemical assay of Na+,K+ ATPase activity in homogenates of total striatum (caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, and internal capsule). Na+,K+ ATPase activity is 60%, 98%, 51%, and 54% of control at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h, respectively. Regionally differential changes in Na+,K+ ATPase function occur in the caudate nucleus and putamen after HI, as demonstrated by histochemical assay for plasma membrane surface-associated Na+,K+ ATPase in piglet brain sections. Before 12 h after HI, Na+,K+ ATPase activity is 73% of control in the caudate nucleus and 67% of control in the putamen. In both the caudate nucleus and putamen at 12 h after HI, Na+,K+ ATPase function recovers to normal levels (or exceeds control values, depending upon the region of caudate nucleus). In caudate nucleus, recovery of Na+,K+ ATPase activity is maintained after 12 h. In contrast, in putamen, Na+,K+ ATPase activity declines (66-78% of control) after 12 h recovery, with the most severe impairment in mid-central putamen. We conclude that delayed impairments in Na+,K+ ATPase function in putamen contribute to the mechanisms for striatal neuron necrosis during the first 24 h after HI in newborns, and that the inability to maintain recovery of Na+,K+ ATPase function may determine selective regional vulnerability to HI in newborns.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "The severity of perinatal hypoxia-ischemia and the delay in initiating therapeutic hypothermia limit the efficacy of hypothermia. After hypoxia-ischemia in neonatal piglets, the arachidonic acid metabolite 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) has been found to contribute to oxidative stress at 3 h of reoxygenation and to eventual neurodegeneration. We tested whether early administration of a 20-HETE synthesis inhibitor after reoxygenation augments neuroprotection with 3-hour delayed hypothermia. In two hypothermic groups, whole body cooling from 38.5 to 34°C was initiated 3 h after hypoxia-ischemia. Rewarming occurred from 20 to 24 h; then anesthesia was discontinued. One hypothermic group received a 20-HETE inhibitor at 5 min after reoxygenation. A sham-operated group and another hypoxia-ischemia group remained normothermic. At 10 days of recovery, resuscitated piglets with delayed hypothermia alone had significantly greater viable neuronal density in the putamen, caudate nucleus, sensorimotor cortex, CA3 hippocampus, and thalamus than did piglets with normothermic recovery, but the values remained less than those in the sham-operated group. In piglets administered the 20-HETE inhibitor before hypothermia, the density of viable neurons in the putamen, cortex and thalamus was significantly greater than in the group with hypothermia alone. Cytochrome P450 4A, which can synthesize 20-HETE, was expressed in piglet neurons in these regions. We conclude that early treatment with a 20-HETE inhibitor enhances the therapeutic benefit of delayed hypothermia in protecting neurons in brain regions known to be particularly vulnerable to hypoxia-ischemia in term newborns.",

        "abstract": "The mechanisms for neuronal apoptosis after axotomy and target deprivation in the adult central nervous system are poorly understood. We used a unilateral occipital cortex ablation model in the adult rat to test the hypothesis that apoptotic retrograde neurodegeneration in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus occurs in association with oxidative stress and mitochondrial abnormalities. Immunodetection of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine, a marker for oxidative injury to DNA, demonstrated that these apoptotic neurons undergo oxidative stress. Dual immunolabeling for the retrograde tracer Fluorogold to identify projection neurons and for 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine demonstrated that apoptotic, oxidatively damaged neurons are geniculocortical projection neurons. By electron microscopy, degeneration of dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus neurons evolved in association with a transient increase in mitochondria within the perikaryon of dying neurons during the transition between chromatolysis and early apoptosis. The morphological integrity of mitochondria was preserved until late in the progression of apoptosis. The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus ipsilateral to the cortical lesion had a transient increase in cytochrome c oxidase activity, and geniculocortical neurons at the transitional, early apoptotic stage accumulated cytochrome c oxidase activity. We conclude that axotomy-induced, retrograde neuronal apoptosis in the adult central nervous system occurs in association with the accumulation of functionally active mitochondria within the perikaryon and oxidative damage to nuclear DNA.",

Over the next several years, we anticipate that transgenic mice recapitulating many of the features of AD will be produced and that these animals will be very useful for defining the etiologies of this disease, for delineating mechanisms of cell dysfunction and death, and for testing novel therapies. Finally, because several other genetic risk factors, including apoE and chromosome 19 and a locus on chromosome 14, have been identified, it is anticipated that future studies will focus on the role of the products of these genes on the cytoskeleton and APP processing, which will represent exciting and challenging new areas of research.",

        "abstract": "Necrostatin-1 inhibits receptor-interacting protein (RIP)-1 kinase and programmed necrosis and is neuroprotective in adult rodent models. Owing to the prominence of necrosis and continuum cell death in neonatal hypoxia–ischemia (HI), we tested whether necrostatin was neuroprotective in the developing brain. Postnatal day (P)7 mice were exposed to HI and injected intracerebroventricularly with 0.1 μL of 80 μmol necrostatin, Nec-1, 5-(1H-Indol-3-ylmethyl)-(2-thio-3-methyl) hydantoin, or vehicle. Necrostatin significantly decreased injury in the forebrain and thalamus at P11 and P28. There was specific neuroprotection in necrostatin-treated males. Necrostatin treatment decreased necrotic cell death and increased apoptotic cell death. Hypoxia–ischemia enforced RIP1–RIP3 complex formation and inhibited RIP3–FADD (Fas-associated protein with death domain) interaction, and these effects were blocked by necrostatin. Necrostatin also decreased HI-induced oxidative damage to proteins and attenuated markers of inflammation coincidental with decreased nuclear factor-κB and caspase 1 activation, and FLIP ((Fas-associated death-domain-like IL-1β-converting enzyme)-inhibitory protein) gene and protein expression. In this model of severe neonatal brain injury, we find that cellular necrosis can be managed therapeutically by a single dose of necrostatin, administered after HI, possibly by interrupting RIP1–RIP3-driven oxidative injury and inflammation. The effects of necrostatin treatment after HI reflect the importance of necrosis in the delayed phases of neonatal brain injury and represent a new direction for therapy of neonatal HI.",

        "abstract": "The cellular and subcellular distributions of the glutamate transporter subtypes EAAC1, GLT-1, and GLAST in the rat CNS were demonstrated using anti-peptide antibodies that recognize the C-terminal domains of each transporter. On immunoblots, the antibodies specifically recognize proteins of 65–73 kDa in total brain homogenates. Immunocytochemistry shows that glutamate transporter subtypes are distributed differentially within neurons and astroglia. EAAC1 is specific for certain neurons, such as large pyramidal cortical neurons and Purkinje cells, but does not appear to be selective for glutamatergic neurons. GLT-1 is localized only to astroglia. GLAST is found in both neurons and astroglia. The regional localizations are unique taeach transporter subtype. EAAC1 is highly enriched in the cortex, hippocampus, and caudate-putamen and is confined to preand postsynaptic elements. GLT-1 is distributed in astrocytes throughout the brain and spinal cord. GLAST is most abundant in Bergmann glia in the cerebellar molecular layer brain, but is also present in the cortex, hippocampus, and deep cerebellar nuclei.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Brain injury in the peripartum period causes a complex array of motor, sensory, cognitive, behavioral, and attentional deficits in survivors suggesting injury to multiple brain systems. The most well studied model of immature brain injury demonstrates severe injury in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to the ligated common carotid. It is thought that injury occurs unilaterally in a distribution determined by the pattern of ischemia. We used silver-staining to demonstrate neuronal-cell body, axonal, and terminal degeneration in rat pup brains injured using the Vannucci model of neonatal *hypoxia-ischemia (H/I). We tested the hypothesis that brain damage is system preferential and has a distribution that follows connectivity patterns. In (n=2) brains analyzed 24, 48, 72 hours(h) following H/I, ipsilateral and contralateral forebrain damage was seen. Uninjured age-matched controls had a minimal basal level of argyrophilia consistent with developmental terminal degeneration and cell death. In H/I brains, abundant neuronal, axonal, and terminal degeneration is seen in ipsilateral and contralateral regions without common vascular supply. Primary motor/sensory systems are injured in a systems preferential manner. Columnar injury in the ipsilateral parasagittal cortex is accompanied by patchy ipsilateral striatal degeneration which varies in intensity with the degree of cortical injury. Specific regions which connect with cortex and striatum including ipsilateral ventrolateral thalamus, substantia nigra reticulata, ipsilateral cerebral pyramids, white matter axonal bundles crossing the midline, and layer V neurons in the contralateral cortex exhibit degeneration. Dying cells in the contralateral cortex exhibit light microscopic features of apoptosis more commonly than do those in the ipsilateral ischemic cortex. Degeneration is also seen in selective limbic system regions including the hippocampus, column of the fornix, mammilothalamic tract, anterior thalamic complex, and mammillary body. Contralateral cortical components of the limbic system also exhibit degeneration. Degeneration in motor, sensory, and limbic systems occurs rapidly following H/I, being present by 24h and without significant progression through 72h. This degeneration of specific brain regions following neonatal H/I reveals preferential vulnerability of brain systems based on neuronal connectivity rather than solely on vascular supply. Additionally, following H/I, the contralateral cortex is damaged in a manner consistent with injury secondary to degeneration of cortico-cortical projections. This pattern of injury is consistent with the complex clinical presentation of the multiply handicapped child following brain injury in the neonatal period.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Striatal neurons are highly vulnerable to hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in term newborns. In a piglet model of HI, striatal neurons develop oxidative stress and organelle disruption by 3–6 h of recovery and ischemic cytopathology over 6–24 h of recovery. We tested the hypothesis that early treatment with the antioxidants EUK-134 (a manganese-salen derivative that acts as a scavenger of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide or NO and peroxynitrite) or edaravone (MCI-186, a scavenger of hydroxyl radical and NO) protects striatal neurons from HI. Anesthetized newborn piglets were subjected to 40 min of hypoxia and 7 min of airway occlusion. At 30 min after resuscitation, the piglets received vehicle, EUK-134 or edaravone. Drug treatment did not affect arterial blood pressure, blood gases, blood glucose or rectal temperature. At 4 days of recovery, the density of viable neurons in the putamen of vehicle-treated piglets was 12 ± 6% (±SD) of sham-operated control density. Treatment with EUK-134 increased viability to 41 ± 17%, and treatment with edaravone increased viability to 39 ± 19%. In the caudate nucleus, neuronal viability was increased from 54 ± 11% in the vehicle group to 78 ± 15% in the EUK-134 group and to 73 ± 13% in the edaravone group. Antioxidant drug treatment accelerated recovery from neurologic deficits and decreased oxidative and nitrative damage to nucleic acids. Treatment with EUK-134 reduced the HI-induced formation of protein carbonyl groups and tyrosine nitration at 3 h of recovery. We conclude that systemic administration of antioxidant agents by 30 min after resuscitation from HI can reduce oxidative stress and salvage neurons in the highly vulnerable striatum in a large-animal model of neonatal HI. Therefore, oxidative stress is an important mechanism for this injury, and antioxidant therapy is a rational, mechanism-based approach to neuroprotection in the newborn brain.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Therapeutic hypothermia provides incomplete neuroprotection after hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced brain injury in neonates. We previously showed that cortical neuron and white matter apoptosis are promoted by hypothermia and early rewarming in a piglet model of HI. The unfolded protein response (UPR) may be one of the potential mediators of this cell death. Here, neonatal piglets underwent HI or sham surgery followed by 29 h of normothermia, 2 h of normothermia + 27 h of hypothermia or 18 h of hypothermia + rewarming. Piglets recovered for 29 h. Immunohistochemistry for endoplasmic reticulum to nucleus signaling-1 protein (ERN1), a marker of UPR activation, was used to determine the ratios of ERN1+ macroglia and neurons in the motor subcortical white matter and cerebral cortex. The ERN1+ macroglia were immunophenotyped as oligodendrocytes and astrocytes by immunofluorescent colabeling. Temperature (p = 0.046) and HI (p < 0.001) independently affected the ratio of ERN1+ macroglia. In sham piglets, sustained hypothermia (p = 0.011) and rewarming (p = 0.004) increased the ERN1+ macroglia ratio above that in normothermia. HI prior to hypothermia diminished the UPR. Ratios of ERN1+ macroglia correlated with white matter apoptotic profile counts in shams (r = 0.472; p = 0.026), thereby associating UPR activation with white matter apoptosis during hypothermia and rewarming. Accordingly, macroglial cell counts decreased in shams that received sustained hypothermia (p = 0.009) or rewarming (p = 0.007) compared to those in normothermic shams. HI prior to hypothermia neutralized the macroglial cell loss. Neither HI nor temperature affected ERN1+ neuron ratios. In summary, delayed hypothermia and rewarming activate the macroglial UPR, which is associated with white matter apoptosis. HI may decrease the macroglial endoplasmic reticulum stress response after hypothermia and rewarming.",

After stoichiometric Feulgen and azure B staining of brain sections, scanning-integrating microdensitometry was used to quantify Feulgen-deoxyribonucleic acid levels, changes in the susceptibility of chromatin to Feulgen acid hydrolysis (F-DNA yield) and azure B-ribonucleic acid (RNA) content of neurons on an individual basis. Changes in neuronal nuclear and nucleolar volumes were also determined histometrically. Within the striatum and sensorimotor cortex, oxotremorine produced marked dose-dependent elevations in both F-DNA yield and RNA content. These metabolic increases were typically paralleled by elevations in nuclear and nucleolar volumes. The data demonstrate that the oxotremorine-induced central muscarinic activation is associated with dose-related enhancements in neuronal chromatin template activity, RNA content, and protein synthetic capacity.",

Human neurons were differentiated from a cortical neuron cell line and the embryonic stem cell-derived H9 line. Mouse neurons were differentiated from forebrain neural stem cells and embryonic cerebral cortex; pig neurons were derived from forebrain neural stem cells. Mitochondrial morphology was different in human and mouse neurons. Human and mouse neurons challenged with DNA-damaging agent camptothecin showed different chromatin condensation, cell death, and DNA damage sensor activation. DNA damage accumulation and repair kinetics differed among human, mouse, and pig neurons.

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "The mechanisms for neurodegeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are not understood. We found that motor neuron degeneration in ALS structurally resembles apoptosis. The progression of neuronal death is divisible into 3 sequential stages: chromatolysis, somatodendritic attrition, and apoptosis. In ALS spinal cord anterior horn and motor cortex, DNA fragmentation is detectable in situ and in gels and is internucleosomal, occurring in the presence of DNA fragmentation factor-45/40 activation and increased caspase-3 activity. By immunoblotting, changes occur in the subcellular distribution of cell death proteins that would promote apoptosis. In selectively vulnerable CNS regions in ALS compared with controls, the proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak are elevated in the mitochondrial-enriched membrane compartment, but are reduced or unchanged in the cytosol. In contrast, the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 is decreased in the mitochondrial-enriched membrane compartment of vulnerable regions in ALS, but is increased in the cytosol, whereas Bcl-xL levels are unchanged in both subcellular compartments. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that Bax-Bax interactions are greater in the mitochondrial-enriched membrane compartment of ALS motor cortex compared with controls, whereas Bax-Bcl-2 interactions are lower in the membrane compartment of ALS motor cortex compared with controls. We conclude that a PCD mechanism, involving cytosol-to-membrane and membrane-to-cytosol redistribution of cell death proteins and caspase-3 activation, participates in the pathogenesis of ALS.",

        "abstract": "The mechanisms of retrograde neurodegeneration following axotomy and target deprivation in the adult central nervous system remain poorly understood. We used a unilateral occipital cortex ablation model in adult rats to test the hypothesis that retrograde neurodegeneration in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus resembles apoptosis. Using the retrograde tracer Fluorogold, combined with nuclear dyes or the terminal transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate–biotin nick end labeling method for detecting nuclear DNA fragmentation, apoptotic geniculocortical projection neurons were identified at approximately six to seven days postlesion. Degeneration of dorsal lateral geniculate neurons was characterized by aberrant accumulation of perikaryal non-phosphorylated neurofilaments and, ultrastructurally, by early vacuolation and subsequent swelling of dendrites. Ultrastructural alterations in the perikaryon of dying dorsal lateral geniculate neurons included the classic chromatolytic response, with redistribution of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and dispersion of free ribosomes followed by fragmentation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, as well as dilatation and vesiculation of the Golgi, and accumulation of intact mitochondria. Subcellular alterations evolved into classic apoptotic changes, including progressive cytoplasmic and nuclear condensation with chromatin compaction into uniformly large round clumps, while the morphological integrity of mitochondria was preserved until late in the progression of neuronal death. Cytoplasmic and then nuclear fragments budded into the surrounding neuropil and were engulfed by oligodendrocytes. We conclude that the retrograde neurodegeneration of geniculocortical neurons in adult brain results in neuronal death which has a phenotype that closely resembles apoptosis. The morphological changes that occur during this process progress from chromatolysis through consecutive stages associated with apoptosis.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Despite the introduction of therapeutic hypothermia, neonatal hypoxic ischemic (HI) brain injury remains a common cause of developmental disability. Development of rational adjuvant therapies to hypothermia requires understanding of the pathways of cell death and survival modulated by HI. The conceptualization of the apoptosis-necrosis “continuum” in neonatal brain injury predicts mechanistic interactions between cell death and hydrid forms of cell death such as programmed or regulated necrosis. Many of the components of the signaling pathway regulating programmed necrosis have been studied previously in models of neonatal HI. In some of these investigations, they participate as part of the apoptotic pathways demonstrating clear overlap of programmed death pathways. Receptor interacting protein (RIP)-1 is at the crossroads between types of cellular death and survival and RIP-1 kinase activity triggers formation of the necrosome (in complex with RIP-3) leading to programmed necrosis. Neuroprotection afforded by the blockade of RIP-1 kinase following neonatal HI suggests a role for programmed necrosis in the HI injury to the developing brain. Here, we briefly review the state of the knowledge about the mechanisms behind programmed necrosis in neonatal brain injury recognizing that a significant proportion of these data derive from experiments in cultured cell and some from in vivo adult animal models. There are still more questions than answers, yet the fascinating new perspectives provided by the understanding of programmed necrosis in the developing brain may lay the foundation for new therapies for neonatal HI.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Synaptic activity in early postnatal life is important for the acquisition of mature structural and functional properties of neurons. Previous studies indicate that the mature molecular features of spinal motor neurons emerge during a period of activity-dependent development in early postnatal life. Since glutamatergic synaptic transmission provides the major excitatory drive into motor neurons, glutamate receptors are likely to play a central role in motor neuron activity-dependent development. To gain insight into this process, we have used receptor autoradiography, immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry to determine the distribution, temporal expression and potential subunit composition of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid subtype glutamate receptors in the developing rat spinal cord. Using two different ligands, [3H]-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid and [3H]-6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, we find that α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid binding sites in the adult are largely restricted to the substantia gelatinosa. In marked contrast, during early postnatal life, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid binding sites are transiently expressed at high levels in the ventral horn. This parallels previous findings on the developmental regulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor expression. Using α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor subunit-specific antibodies we show by immunoblot analysis and immunohistology that, to varying degrees, the expression patterns of glutamate receptor subunit 1 and glutamate receptor subunits2/3 are significantly developmentally regulated. The most conspicuous change is the downregulation of glutamate receptor 1 expression within motor neurons over the first three weeks of postnatal life.",

        "abstract": "In individuals with Alzheimer disease and in aged nonhuman primates, deposits of amyloid occur in senile plaques in brain parenchyma and in the walls of some meningeal and cortical vessels. Amyloid is primarily composed of beta/A4, a 4-kDa peptide derived from the transmembrane form of an amyloid precursor protein (APP). We examined the distribution of beta/A4 and APP (outside the beta/A4 domain) in cerebral cortices of monkeys ranging in age from 4 to 41 years. In all animals, APP immunoreactivity was present in cell bodies, proximal dendrites, and axons of cortical neurons. In aged animals, all of which showed senile plaques, large APP-positive axons were conspicuous, and APP immunoreactivity was present in neurites around beta/A4-immunoreactive plaques. In some plaques, APP-immunoreactive elements were located in proximity to deposits of beta/A4. The presence of APP immunoreactivity in neuronal perikarya, dendrites, axons, and in neurites within beta/A4-containing plaques supports the hypothesis that neurons can serve as one source of amyloid deposited in brain parenchyma.",

        "abstract": "Effective therapies are needed for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal type of motor neuron disease. Morphological, biochemical, molecular genetic, and cell/animal model studies suggest that mitochondria have potentially diverse roles in neurodegenerative disease mechanisms and neuronal cell death. In human ALS, abnormalities have been found in mitochondrial structure, mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, and mitochondrial cell death proteins indicative of some non-classical form of programmed cell death. Mouse models of ALS are beginning to reveal possible principles governing the biology of selective neuronal vulnerability that implicate mitochondria. This minireview summarizes work on the how malfunctioning mitochondria might contribute to neuronal death in ALS through the biophysical entity called the mitochondrial permeability pore (mPTP). The major protein components of the mPTP are enriched in mouse motor neurons. Early in the course of disease in ALS mice expressing human mutant superoxide dismutase-1, mitochondria in motor neurons undergo trafficking abnormalities and dramatic remodeling resulting in the formation of mega-mitochondria and coinciding with increased protein carbonyl formation and nitration of mPTP components. The genetic deletion of a major mPTP component, cyclophilin D, has robust effects in ALS mice by delaying disease onset and extending survival. Thus, attention should be directed to the mPTP as a rational target for the development of drugs designed to treat ALS.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Therapeutic hypothermia is widely used to treat neonatal hypoxic ischemic (HI) brain injuries. However, potentially deleterious effects of delaying the induction of hypothermia and of rewarming on white matter injury remain unclear. We used a piglet model of HI to assess the effects of delayed hypothermia and rewarming on white matter apoptosis. Piglets underwent HI injury or sham surgery followed by normothermic or hypothermic recovery at 2 h. Hypothermic groups were divided into those with no rewarming, slow rewarming at 0.5 °C/h, or rapid rewarming at 4 °C/h. Apoptotic cells in the subcortical white matter of the motor gyrus, corpus callosum, lateral olfactory tract, and internal capsule at 29 h were identified morphologically and counted by hematoxylin & eosin staining. Cell death was verified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. White matter neurons were also counted, and apoptotic cells were immunophenotyped with the oligodendrocyte marker 2′,3′-cyclic-nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase). Hypothermia, slow rewarming, and rapid rewarming increased apoptosis in the subcortical white matter relative to normothermia (p < 0.05). The number of white matter neurons was not lower in groups with more apoptosis after hypothermia or rapid rewarming, indicating that the apoptosis occurred among glial cells. Hypothermic piglets had more apoptosis in the lateral olfactory tract than those that were rewarmed (p < 0.05). The promotion of apoptosis by hypothermia and rewarming in these regions was independent of HI. In the corpus callosum, HI piglets had more apoptosis than shams after normothermia, slow rewarming, and rapid rewarming (p < 0.05). Many apoptotic cells were myelinating oligodendrocytes identified by CNPase positivity. Our results indicate that delaying the induction of hypothermia and rewarming are associated with white matter apoptosis in a piglet model of HI; in some regions these temperature effects are independent of HI. Vulnerable cells include myelinating oligodendrocytes. This study identifies a deleterious effect of therapeutic hypothermia in the developing brain.",

        "abstract": "The olfactory bulb (OB) core is an extension of the rostral migratory stream and thus is a potential source of neural progenitor and neural stem cells. We characterized in vivo and in vitro neuronal progenitor and neural stem cells in the adult OB core. In mouse and rat, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling showed that the OB core accumulates newly replicated cells. Nestin, a neuroepithelial stem cell marker, was enriched in the OB core. BrdU‐positive cells were immunolabeled for nestin and TUC4, a marker for early postmitotic neurons. The distributions of cells labeled for BrdU, TUC4, and nestin were similarly concentrated in the OB core. Nestin‐ and TUC4‐positive cells were also found in the OB of young and aged humans. Isolated and cultured OB core cells from adult rat and mouse had the capacity to generate numerous neurospheres. Adult OB core neurospheres were cryopreserved and subsequently cultured. Single cell clonal analysis of neurospheres revealed the capacity for self‐renewal and multipotency. Cultured adult OB core cells differentiated into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Some neurons expressed choline acetlytransferase, substance P, and glutamic acid decarboxylase. Basic fibroblast growth factor potentiated the self‐renewal of cells and β‐nerve growth factor stimulated differentiation. OB‐derived neural stem cells in coculture with skeletal muscle cells were induced to become neurons expressing choline acetyltransferase and substance P and formed neuromuscular synaptic junctions on myocytes displaying acetylcholinesterase‐positive motor end plates. Cocultured OB‐derived neural stem cells with myoblast cells also generated nonneural cell progeny. We conclude that the adult mammalian OB core is a reservoir of neural progenitor cells and pluripotent neural stem cells",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Therapeutic hypothermia is the standard of clinical care for moderate neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. We investigated the independent and interactive effects of hypoxia-ischemia (HI) and temperature on neuronal survival and injury in basal ganglia and cerebral cortex in neonatal piglets. Male piglets were randomized to receive HI injury or sham procedure followed by 29 h of normothermia, sustained hypothermia induced at 2 h, or hypothermia with rewarming during fentanyl-nitrous oxide anesthesia. Viable and injured neurons and apoptotic profiles were counted in the anterior putamen, posterior putamen, and motor cortex at 29 h after HI injury or sham procedure. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) identified genomic DNA fragmentation to confirm cell death. Though hypothermia after HI preserved viable neurons in the anterior and posterior putamen, hypothermia prevented neuronal injury in only the anterior putamen. Hypothermia initiated 2 h after injury did not protect against apoptotic cell death in either the putamen or motor cortex, and rewarming from hypothermia was associated with increased apoptosis in the motor cortex. In non-HI shams, sustained hypothermia during anesthesia was associated with neuronal injury and corresponding viable neuron loss in the anterior putamen and motor cortex. TUNEL confirmed increased neurodegeneration in the putamen of hypothermic shams. Anesthetized, normothermic shams did not show abnormal neuronal cytopathology in the putamen or motor cortex, thereby demonstrating minimal contribution of the anesthetic regimen to neuronal injury during normothermia. We conclude that the efficacy of hypothermic protection after HI is region specific and that hypothermia during anesthesia in the absence of HI may be associated with neuronal injury in the developing brain. Studies examining the potential interactions between hypothermia and anesthesia, as well as with longer durations of hypothermia, are needed.",

        "abstract": "The recently developed oscillating-gradient diffusion MRI (OG-dMRI) technique extends our ability to examine brain structures at different spatial scales. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity of OG-dMRI in detecting cellular and subcellular structural changes in a mouse model of neonatal hypoxia ischemia (HI). Neonatal mice received unilateral HI injury or sham injury at postnatal day 10, followed by in vivo T2-weighted and diffusion MRI of the brains at 3–6 h and 24 h after HI. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were acquired using conventional pulsed-gradient dMRI (PG-dMRI) and OG-dMRI with oscillating frequencies from 50 to 200 Hz. Pathology at cellular and subcellular levels was evaluated using neuronal, glial, and mitochondrial markers. We found significantly higher rates of ADC increase with oscillating frequencies (ΔfADC) in the ipsilateral edema region, compared to the contralateral side, starting as early as 3 h after HI. Even in injured regions that showed no apparent change in PG-ADC or pseudo-normalized PG-ADC measurements, ΔfADC remained significantly elevated. Histopathology showed swelling of sub-cellular structures in these regions with no apparent whole-cell level change. These results suggest that OG-dMRI is sensitive to subcellular structural changes in the brain after HI and is less susceptible to pseudo-normalization than PG-dMRI.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Activation of phospholipase C (PLC) increases intracellular Ca++ and may play a role in delayed neuronal death after ischemia. Because changes in intracellular Ca++ are believed to participate in ischemic neuronal injury, we tested the hypothesis that PLCβ protein levels are temporally altered in brain regions that undergo neurodegeneration after global incomplete ischemia. Dogs (n = 12) were subjected to 20 minutes of global incomplete ischemia followed by recovery of either 1 (n = 5) or 7 days (n = 7). Six sham-operated animals were used as nonischemic controls. In hematoxylin and eosin-stained brain sections, neuronal density at 1 day after ischemia was unchanged relative to nonischemic controls in hippocampus CA1, caudate, and cerebellar cortex (anterior lobule). However, at 7 days after ischemia, neuronal densities were decreased to 56 ± 15% (mean ± SD) and 75 ± 17% of control in CA1 and caudate, respectively. At 1 and 7 days after ischemia, the percentage of neurons showing ischemic injury increased from 13 ± 10 to 40 ± 35% in CA1, 24 ± 25 to 59 ± 16% in cerebellum, and 4 ± 2 to 18 ± 12% in caudate. Densitometric analysis of immunocytochemically stained brain sections from controls (n = 3), 1 day after ischemia (n = 3), and 7 days after ischemia (n = 5) revealed that PLCβ immunoreactivity was increased in cerebellum at 1 day (0.274 ± 0.013 v 0.295 ± 0.005 optical density units [OD] in control and 1 day, respectively) and 7 days (0.108 ± 0.009 v 0.116 ± 0.005 O.D. in control and 7 days, respectively). PLCβ immunoreactivity was unchanged after ischemia in caudate and hippocampus. Western blot analysis of PLCβ immunoreactivity in the cerebellar cortex and hippocampus in the control (n = 3), 1 day (n = 2), and 7 days after ischemia (n = 2) groups showed that PLCβ levels were increased after ischemia in cerebellum 266% and 227% above control at 1 and 7 days, respectively, However, in hippocampus, PLC expression after ischemia was unchanged at 97% and 84% of control at 1 and 7 days, respectively. These results show that delayed neuronal degeneration after global incomplete ischemia is accompanied by regional abnormalities in PLC levels. Elevated PLC levels early may represent an aberrant signal transduction mechanism resulting in delayed cell damage, whereas decreased PLC levels later after ischemia may reflect ongoing neurodegeneration.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by weakness, muscle atrophy, and spasticity, is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease. Although the majority of ALS cases are sporadic, ∼5–10% are familial, including those linked to mutations in SOD1 (Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase). Missense mutations in a dynactin gene (DCTN1) encoding the p150Glued subunit of dynactin have been linked to both familial and sporadic ALS. To determine the molecular mechanism whereby mutant dynactin p150Glued causes selective degeneration of motor neurons, we generated and characterized mice expressing either wild-type or mutant human dynactin p150Glued. Neuronal expression of mutant, but not wild type, dynactin p150Glued causes motor neuron disease in these animals that are characterized by defects in vesicular transport in cell bodies of motor neurons, axonal swelling and axo-terminal degeneration. Importantly, we provide evidence that autophagic cell death is implicated in the pathogenesis of mutant p150Glued mice. This novel mouse model will be instrumental for not only clarifying disease mechanisms in ALS, but also for testing therapeutic strategies to ameliorate this devastating disease.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Effects of prior hypoxia acclimation (14-day at 380 mm Hg) on soman (pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate) induced brain neuronal RNA and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) depletion and lethality were monitored in rats following their return to ambient oxygenation. Quantitative cytochemical techniques were used to measure RNA and AChE changes in individual cerebrocortical (Layer III) and striatal (caudate plus putamen) neurons. In ambient PO 2 controls, soman eventuated in a moderate diminution of neuronal RNA in both brain regions and severe, dosedependent suppression of AChE activity. Hypoxia acclimation per se induced RNA alterations as manifested in cortical RNA depletion and increased variability of striatal neuron RNA contents. In hypoxia acclimated rats, the extent of neuronal RNA depletion following soman injection was attenuated in both brain regions, yet there were no discernible differences in saline control AChE levels or in the extent of soman-induced AChE inhibition in ambient control versus hypoxia acclimated treatment groups. Hypoxia acclimated rats, however, were found to be even more susceptible to lethal actions of soman as assessed using 24- and 48-hour survival following a three-point treatment regimen. These data indicate that while compensatory systemic and central metabolic adjustments associated with 14d acclimation to reduced oxygen availability may retard soman-induced neuronal RNA depletion, resistance to lethal or near-lethal soman exposure is not enhanced. It is postulated that hypoxia acclimation is associated with complex adaptive and maladaptive neurophysiological alterations influencing CNS responsiveness to soman toxication, and that detrimental consequences exceed protection afforded by metabolic adaptation.",

        "abstract": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 g) were injected subcutaneously with soman, a potent neuronal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, at doses of 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 LD50 (1 LD50=135 μg/kg) before decapitation at 1 and 24 h post-exposure. Correlative data were obtained on the severity of brain AChE inactivation and physicochemical changes in nuclear chromatin of cerebrocortical (layer V) and striatal neurons using Feulgen-DNA (F-DNA) cytophotometry and ocular filar micrometry. Decreased lability of neurons to F-DNA acid hydrolysis (reduced F-DNA yield), nuclear shrinkage and chromatin aggregation (decreased chromophore area) were used as indices of suppression of genomic template activity; conversely, increases in F-DNA yield and chromophore area signify enhanced neuroexcitation. At 1 hr post-soman there was a dose-dependent inactivation of AChE with a moderate increase in chromatin activation, i.e., nuclear hypertrophy and chromatin dispersion. At 24 hr post-soman there was a partial restoration of AChE activity, notably in striatal neurons, with a suppression in chromatin template activity. These data indicate that actions of soman on neuronal functioning are time-dependent. The absence of any dose-related neuronal chromatin changes may signify existence of non-cholinergic mediated events.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of motoneurons. Hyperexcitability and excitotoxicity have been implicated in the early pathogenesis of ALS. Studies addressing excitotoxic motoneuron death and intracellular Ca2+ overload have mostly focused on Ca2+ influx through AMPA glutamate receptors. However, intrinsic excitability of motoneurons through voltage-gated ion channels may also have a role in the neurodegeneration. In this study we examined the function and localization of voltage-gated Ca2 + channels in cultured spinal cord motoneurons from mice expressing a mutant form of human superoxide dismutase-1 with a Gly93 → Ala substitution (G93A-SOD1). Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, we showed that high voltage activated (HVA) Ca2 + currents are increased in G93A-SOD1 motoneurons, but low voltage activated Ca2 + currents are not affected. G93A-SOD1 motoneurons also have altered persistent Ca2 + current mediated by L-type Ca2 + channels. Quantitative single-cell RT-PCR revealed higher levels of Ca1a, Ca1b, Ca1c, and Ca1e subunit mRNA expression in G93A-SOD1 motoneurons, indicating that the increase of HVA Ca2 + currents may result from upregulation of Ca2 + channel mRNA expression in motoneurons. The localizations of the Ca1B N-type and Ca1D L-type Ca2 + channels in motoneurons were examined by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. G93A-SOD1 motoneurons had increased Ca1B channels on the plasma membrane of soma and dendrites. Ca1D channels are similar on the plasma membrane of soma and lower on the plasma membrane of dendrites of G93A-SOD1 motoneurons. Our study demonstrates that voltage-gated Ca2 + channels have aberrant functions and localizations in ALS mouse motoneurons. The increased HVA Ca2 + currents and PCCa current could contribute to early pathogenesis of ALS.",

        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of motor neurons (MNs). The molecular pathogenesis of ALS is not understood, thus effective therapies for this disease are lacking. Some forms of ALS are inherited by mutations in the superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) gene. Transgenic mice expressing human Gly93 → Ala (G93A) mutant SOD1 (mSOD1) develop severe MN disease, oxidative and nitrative damage, and mitochondrial pathology that appears to involve nitric oxide-mediated mechanisms. We used G93A-mSOD1 mice to test the hypothesis that the degeneration of MNs is associated with an aberrant up-regulation of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOS2) activity within MNs. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation showed that iNOS protein levels in mitochondrial-enriched membrane fractions of spinal cord are increased significantly in mSOD1 mice at pre-symptomatic stages of disease. The catalytic activity of iNOS was also increased significantly in mitochondrial-enriched membrane fractions of mSOD1 mouse spinal cord at pre-symptomatic stages of disease. Reverse transcription-PCR showed that iNOS mRNA was present in the spinal cord and brainstem MN regions in mice and was increased in pre-symptomatic and early symptomatic mice. Immunohistochemistry showed that iNOS immunoreactivty was up-regulated first in spinal cord and brainstem MNs in pre-symptomatic and early symptomatic mice and then later in the course of disease in numerous microglia and few astrocytes. iNOS accumulated in the mitochondria in mSOD1 mouse MNs. iNOS immunoreactivity was also up-regulated in Schwann cells of peripheral nerves and was enriched particularly at the paranodal regions of the nodes of Ranvier. Drug inhibitors of iNOS delayed disease onset and significantly extended the lifespan of G93A-mSOD1 mice. This work identifies two new potential early mechanisms for MN degeneration in mouse ALS involving iNOS at MN mitochondria and Schwann cells and suggests that therapies targeting iNOS might be beneficial in treating human ALS.",

        "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that subtypes of glutamate receptors (GluRs) are differentially expressed during corticogenesis. The neocortex of fetal sheep (term = ∼145 days) was evaluated by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry to determine the protein expression of α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors (GluR1, GluR2/GluR3 [GluR2/3], and GluR4), kainate (KA) receptors (GluR6/GluR7 [GluR6/7]), and a metabotropic GluR (mGluR5). AMPA/KA receptors and mGluR5 were expressed in neocortex by midgestation. GluR1 and mGluR5 expression increased progressively, with expression being maximal just before birth and then decreasing postnatally. GluR2/3 and GluR6/7 levels increased progressively during corticogenesis to reach adult levels near term. GluR4 was expressed at low levels during corticogenesis and in adult neocortex. The localizations of GluRs in the developing neocortex were distinct. Each GluR had a differential localization within the marginal zone, cortical plate, and subplate. GluR subtypes were expressed in laminar patterns before major cytoarchitectonic segregation occurred based on Nissl staining, although connectional patterns were emergent by midgestation based on labeling of corticostriatal projections with DiI. The GluR localizations changed during cortical plate segregation, resulting in highly differential distributions in the neocortex at term. AMPA/KA receptors were expressed transiently in proliferative zones and in developing white matter. Oligodendrocytes in fetal brain expressed AMPA receptors. The expression of ion channel and metabotropic GluR subtypes is dynamic during corticogenesis, with subtype‐ and subunit‐specific regulation occurring during the laminar segregation of the cortical plate and differentiation of the neocortex",

        "abstract": "The mechanisms for neurodegeneration after hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in newborns are not understood. We tested the hypothesis that striatal neuron death is necrosis and evolves with oxidative stress and selective organelle damage. Piglets (∼1 week old) were used in a model of hypoxia-asphyxia and survived for 3, 6, 12, or 24 h. Neuronal death was progressive over 3–24 h recovery, with ∼80% of putaminal neurons dead at 24 h. Striatal DNA was digested randomly at 6–12 h. Ultrastructurally, dying neurons were necrotic. Damage to the Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum occurred at 3–12 h, while most mitochondria appeared intact until 12 h. Mitochondria showed early suppression of activity, then a transient burst of activity at 6 h, followed by mitochondrial failure (determined by cytochrome c oxidase assay). Cytochrome c was depleted at 6 h after HI and thereafter. Damage to lysosomes occurred within 3–6 h. By 3 h recovery, glutathione levels were reduced, and peroxynitrite-mediated oxidative damage to membrane proteins, determined by immunoblots for nitrotyrosine, occurred at 3–12 h. The Golgi apparatus and cytoskeleton were early targets for extensive tyrosine nitration. Striatal neurons also sustained hydroxyl radical damage to DNA and RNA within 6 h after HI. We conclude that early glutathione depletion and oxidative stress between 3 and 6 h reperfusion promote damage to membrane and cytoskeletal proteins, DNA and RNA, as well as damage to most organelles, thereby causing neuronal necrosis in the striatum of newborns after HI.",

        "title": "Skeletal muscle DNA damage precedes spinal motor neuron DNA damage in a mouse model of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)",
        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a hereditary childhood disease that causes paralysis by progressive degeneration of skeletal muscles and spinal motor neurons. SMA is associated with reduced levels of full-length Survival of Motor Neuron (SMN) protein, due to mutations in the Survival of Motor Neuron 1 gene. The mechanisms by which lack of SMN causes SMA pathology are not known, making it very difficult to develop effective therapies. We investigated whether DNA damage is a perinatal pathological event in SMA, and whether DNA damage and cell death first occur in skeletal muscle or spinal cord of SMA mice. We used a mouse model of severe SMA to ascertain the extent of cell death and DNA damage throughout the body of prenatal and newborn mice. SMA mice at birth (postnatal day 0) exhibited internucleosomal fragmentation in genomic DNA from hindlimb skeletal muscle, but not in genomic DNA from spinal cord. SMA mice at postnatal day 5, compared with littermate controls, exhibited increased apoptotic cell death profiles in skeletal muscle, by hematoxylin and eosin, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling, and electron microscopy. SMA mice had no increased cell death, no loss of choline acetyl transferase (ChAT)-positive motor neurons, and no overt pathology in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. At embryonic days 13 and 15.5, SMA mice did not exhibit statistically significant increases in cell death profiles in spinal cord or skeletal muscle. Motor neuron numbers in the ventral horn, as identified by ChAT immunoreactivity, were comparable in SMA mice and control littermates at embryonic day 15.5 and postnatal day 5. These observations demonstrate that in SMA, disease in skeletal muscle emerges before pathology in spinal cord, including loss of motor neurons. Overall, this work identifies DNA damage and cell death in skeletal muscle as therapeutic targets for SMA.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Although cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) is closely related to other cyclin-dependent kinases, its kinase activity is detected only in the postmitotic neurons. Cdk5 expression and kinase activity are correlated with the extent of differentiation of neuronal cells in developing brain. Cdk5 purified from nervous tissue phosphorylates neuronal cytoskeletal proteins including neurofilament proteins and microtubule-associated protein tau in vitro. These findings indicate that Cdk5 may have unique functions in neuronal cells, especially in the regulation of phosphorylation of cytoskeletal molecules. We report here generation of Cdk5(-/-) mice through gene targeting and their phenotypic analysis. Cdk5(-/-) mice exhibit unique lesions in the central nervous system associated with perinatal mortality. The brains of Cdk5(-/-) mice lack cortical laminar structure and cerebellar foliation. In addition, the large neurons in the brain stem and in the spinal cord show chromatolytic changes with accumulation of neurofilament immunoreactivity. These findings indicate that Cdk5 is an important molecule for brain development and neuronal differentiation and also suggest that Cdk5 may play critical roles in neuronal cytoskeleton structure and organization.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of motor neurons (MNs) that causes skeletal muscle paralysis. Familial forms of ALS are linked to mutations in the superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) gene. The mechanisms of human SOD1 (hSOD1) toxicity to MNs are unknown. We hypothesized that skeletal muscle is a primary site of pathogenesis in ALS that triggers MN degeneration. We created transgenic (tg) mice expressing wild-type-, G37R- and G93A-hSOD1 gene variants only in skeletal muscle. These tg mice developed age-related neurologic and pathologic phenotypes consistent with ALS. Affected mice showed limb weakness and paresis with motor deficits. Skeletal muscles developed severe pathology involving oxidative damage, protein nitration, myofiber cell death and marked neuromuscular junction (NMJ) abnormalities. Spinal MNs developed distal axonopathy and formed ubiquitinated inclusions and degenerated through an apoptotic-like pathway involving capsase-3. Mice expressing wild-type and mutant forms of hSOD1 developed MN pathology. These results demonstrate that human SOD1 in skeletal muscle has a causal role in ALS and identify a new non-autonomous mechanism for MN degeneration explaining their selective vulnerability. The discovery of instigating molecular toxicities or disease progression determinants within skeletal muscle could be very valuable for the development of new effective therapies for the treatment and cure of ALS.",

        "abstract": "We studied neuronal cell body, axonal, and terminal degeneration in brains from 7-day-old rat pups recovered for 0, 1.5, 3, 6, 24, 48, 72 h, and 6 days following hypoxia-ischemia and identified proteins involved in the delayed neurodegeneration in the thalamus. We found that injury is biphasic with initial necrosis in the ipsilateral forebrain by 3 h following hypoxia-ischemia, in contrast to more delayed and apoptotic-like injury in the ventral-basal thalamus, brainstem, and other remote non-forebrain regions. Prior to the appearance of large numbers of apoptotic profiles in the ventral-basal thalamus, expression of Fas death receptor protein, activated forms of caspase 8 and caspase 3, and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are increased. This manuscript combines our data on hypoxic-ischemic injury in the developing brain and presents evidence for at least two forms of neurodegeneration, namely, acute necrosis in the forebrain and delayed neurodegeneration in the thalamus, which is death-receptor-mediated programmed cell death.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "The cellular distributions of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4- isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors within the rodent and nonhuman primate basal forebrain magnocellular complex (BFMC) were demonstrated immunocytochemically using anti-peptide antibodies that recognize glutamate receptor (GluR) subunit proteins (i.e., GluR1, GluR4, and a conserved region of GluR2, GluR3, and GluR4c). In both species, many large GluR1-positive neuronal perikarya and aspiny dendrites are present within the medial septal nucleus, the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, and the nucleus basalis of Meynert. In this population of neurons in rat and monkey, GluR2/3/4c and GluR4 immunoreactivities are less abundant than GluR1 immunoreactivity. In rat, GluR1 does not colocalize with ChAT, but, within many neurons, GluR1 does colocalize with GABA, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and parvalbumin immunoreactivities. GluR1- and GABA/GAD-positive neurons intermingle extensively with ChAT-positive neurons. In monkey, however, most GluR1-immunoreactive neurons express ChAT and calbindin-D28 immunoreactivities. The results reveal that noncholinergic GABAergic neurons, within the BFMC of rat, express AMPA receptors, whereas cholinergic neurons in the BFMC of monkey express AMPA receptors. Thus, the cellular localizations of the AMPA subtype of GluR are different within the BFMC of rat and monkey, suggesting that excitatory synaptic regulation of distinct subsets of BFMC neurons may differ among species. We conclude that, in the rodent, BFMC GABAergic neurons receive glutamatergic inputs, whereas cholinergic neurons either do not receive glutamatergic synapses or utilize GluR subtypes other than AMPA receptors. In contrast, in primate, basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are innervated directly by glutamatergic afferents and utilize AMPA receptors.",

Halothane-anesthetized cats (n = 6 for each group) were treated with intravenous saline, L-NAME (5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg), or L-arginine (300 mg/kg) 30 minutes before 10 minutes of ischemia (temporary ligation of the left subclavian and brachiocephalic arteries with hemorrhagic hypotension to 50 mm Hg). At 30 minutes of reperfusion, cats in the L-ARG group were administered an additional 300 mg/kg dose of intravenous L-arginine.

        "abstract": "Cell death is important in the normal histogenesis of organs, steady state kinetics of healthy adult tissues, pathogenesis of tissue damage and disease, and disease therapy. Pathologists conceived the concept of cell death as a mechanism for disease to aid in diagnosis and therapy (Virchow, 1858). Developmental biologists then realized the essential role of cell death in tissue and organ development (Glücksmann, 1951; Lockshin and Williams, 1964; Saunders, 1966). This idea was at first received with skepticism, but now it is dogma that cell number in tissues is controlled precisely in developing and adult tissues. The absence of this precise control of cell number in tissues causes cancer (impaired apoptosis is a central step toward neoplasia). Pathologic stimuli can be extrinsic or intrinsic and can inactivate normal cell death networks or can cause abrupt or delayed cell death. Cell demise can occur as multiple types of death (Schweichel and Merker, 1973; Lockshin and Zakeri, 2002). It is compelling that a goal of human disease therapy is, on the one hand, to prevent cell death in neurologic disease and, on the other hand, to stimulate cell death in malignancy. Thus, the study of cell death is fundamental to human pathobiology and disease treatment. In this chapter, recent critical views on the contributions of the different forms of cell death to human neurodegenerative diseases and their animal and cell models will be presented.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "We developed an isolation technique for motor neurons from adult rat spinal cord. Spinal cord enlargements were discretely microdissected into ventral horn tissue columns that were trypsin-digested and subjected to differential low-speed centrifugation to fractionate ventral horn cell types. A fraction enriched in α-motor neurons was isolated. Motor neuron enrichment was verified by immunofluorescence for choline acetyltransferase and prelabeling axon projections to skeletal muscle. Adult motor neurons were isolated from naïve rats and were exposed to oxidative agents or were isolated from rats with sciatic nerve lesions (avulsions). We tested the hypothesis, using single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay), that hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, and peroxynitrite exposure in vitro and axotomy in vivo induce DNA damage in adult motor neurons early during their degeneration. This study contributes three important developments in the study of motor neurons. It demonstrates that mature spinal motor neurons can be isolated and used for in vitro models of motor neuron degeneration. It shows that adult motor neurons can be isolated from in vivo models of motor neuron degeneration and evaluated on a single-cell basis. This study also demonstrates that the comet assay is a feasible method for measuring DNA damage in individual motor neurons. Using these methods, we conclude that motor neurons undergoing oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species and axotomy accumulate DNA damage early in their degeneration.",

        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease of motor neurons (MNs) that causes paralysis. Some forms of ALS are inherited, caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) gene. The mechanisms of human mutant SOD1 (mSOD1) toxicity to MNs are unresolved. Mitochondria in MNs might be key sites for ALS pathogenesis, but cause–effect relationships between mSOD1 and mitochondriopathy need further study. We used transgenic mSOD1 mice to test the hypothesis that the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) is involved in the MN degeneration of ALS. Components of the multi-protein mPTP are expressed highly in mouse MNs, including the voltage-dependent anion channel, adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), and cyclophilin D (CyPD), and are present in mitochondria marked by manganese SOD. MNs in pre-symptomatic mSOD1-G93A mice form swollen megamitochondria with CyPD immunoreactivity. Early disease is associated with mitochondrial cristae remodeling and matrix vesiculation in ventral horn neuron dendrites. MN cell bodies accumulate mitochondria derived from the distal axons projecting to skeletal muscle. Incipient disease in spinal cord is associated with increased oxidative and nitrative stress, indicated by protein carbonyls and nitration of CyPD and ANT. Reducing the levels of CyPD by genetic ablation significantly delays disease onset and extends the lifespan of G93A-mSOD1 mice expressing high and low levels of mutant protein in a gender-dependent pattern. These results demonstrate that mitochondria have causal roles in the disease mechanisms in MNs in ALS mice. This work defines a new mitochondrial mechanism for MN degeneration in ALS.",

Recently we studied glycine receptors (GlyRs) in motoneurons in an ALS mouse model expressing a mutant form of human superoxide dismutase-1 with a Gly93→Ala substitution (G93A-SOD1). Living motoneurons in dissociated spinal cord cultures were identified by using transgenic mice expressing eGFP driven by the Hb9 promoter. We showed that GlyR-mediated currents were reduced in large-sized (diameter > 28 μm) Hb9-eGFP+ motoneurons from G93A-SOD1 embryonic mice. Here we analyze GlyR currents in a morphologically distinct subgroup of medium-sized (diameter 10-28 μm) Hb9-eGFP+ motoneurons, presumably gamma or slow-type alpha motoneurons. We find that glycine-induced current densities were not altered in medium-sized G93A-SOD1 motoneurons. No significant differences in glycinergic mIPSCs were observed between G93A-SOD1 and control medium-sized motoneurons. These results indicate that GlyR deficiency early in the disease process of ALS is specific for large alpha motoneurons.",

        "abstract": "This study tested the application of an immunoisotopic assay for immunohistochemical localization and quantification of proteins in brain sections from rats without or with transient focal ischemia. We assessed the hypothesis that measurements of protein levels in injured brain determined by an isotopic assay using [125I]–protein A have greater reliability than those made by conventional immunoperoxidase labeling using diaminobenzidine. Quantification of immunoreactivities for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) and heat shock protein-70 (HSP-70) was determined by optical density signal in the immunoisotopic and immunoperoxidase assays. In ischemic brain, the immunoisotopic assay detected protein increases (cortical penumbra HSP-70, 151 ± 6%), protein decreases (cortical ischemic core GLT-1, 61 ± 6%) and no changes in GFAP levels compared to controls animals. These results differed from the protein levels found by the immunoperoxidase assay, which showed elevated HSP-70, GLT-1 and GFAP in all ischemic regions. We conclude that nonspecific immunosignal confounds assessments of protein expression in injured brain and that the immunoisotopic method is a valid approach to regionally localize and quantify proteins after brain injury. The disadvantage of the falsely positive overestimation of protein immunoreactivity after stroke with the immunoperoxidase method has to be weighted with the advantage of the cellular resolution.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal brain injury from hypoxia-ischemia (HI) causes major morbidity. Piglet HI is an established method for testing neuroprotective treatments in large, gyrencephalic brain. Though many neurobehavior tests exist for rodents, such tests and their associations with neuropathologic injury remain underdeveloped and underutilized in large, neonatal HI animal models. We examined whether spatial T-maze and inclined beam tests distinguish cognitive and motor differences between HI and sham piglets and correlate with neuropathologic injury. Neonatal piglets were randomized to whole-body HI or sham procedure, and they began T-maze and inclined beam testing 17 days later. HI piglets had more incorrect T-maze turns than did shams. Beam walking time did not differ between groups. Neuropathologic evaluations at 33 days validated the injury with putamen neuron loss after HI to below that of sham procedure. HI decreased the numbers of CA3 pyramidal neurons but not CA1 pyramidal neurons or dentate gyrus granule neurons. Though the number of hippocampal parvalbumin-positive interneurons did not differ between groups, HI reduced the number of CA1 interneuron dendrites. Piglets with more incorrect turns had greater CA3 neuron loss, and piglets that took longer in the maze had fewer CA3 interneurons. The number of putamen neurons was unrelated to T-maze or beam performance. We conclude that neonatal HI causes hippocampal CA3 neuron loss, CA1 interneuron dendritic attrition, and putamen neuron loss at 1-month recovery. The spatial T-maze identifies learning and memory deficits that are related to loss of CA3 pyramidal neurons and fewer parvalbumin-positive interneurons independent of putamen injury.",

        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly evolving and fatal adult-onset neurological disease characterized by progressive degeneration of motoneurons. Our previous study showed that glycinergic innervation of spinal motoneurons is deficient in an ALS mouse model expressing a mutant form of human superoxide dismutase-1 with a Gly93→Ala substitution (G93A–SOD1). In this study, we have examined, using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, glycine receptor (GlyR)-mediated currents in spinal motoneurons from these transgenic mice. We developed a dissociated spinal cord culture model using embryonic transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) driven by the Hb9 promoter. Motoneurons were identified as Hb9–eGFP-expressing (Hb9–eGFP+) neurons with a characteristic morphology. To examine GlyRs in ALS motoneurons, we bred G93A–SOD1 mice to Hb9–eGFP mice and compared glycine-evoked currents in cultured Hb9–eGFP+ motoneurons prepared from G93A–SOD1 embryos and from their nontransgenic littermates. Glycine-evoked current density was significantly smaller in the G93A–SOD1 motoneurons compared with control. Furthermore, the averaged current densities of spontaneous glycinergic miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) were significantly smaller in the G93A–SOD1 motoneurons than in control motoneurons. No significant differences in GABA-induced currents and GABAergic mIPSCs were observed between G93A–SOD1 and control motoneurons. Quantitative single-cell reverse transcription-PCR found lower GlyRα1 subunit mRNA expression in G93A–SOD1 motoneurons, indicating that the reduction of GlyR current may result from the downregulation of GlyR mRNA expression in motoneurons. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated a decrease of surface postsynaptic GlyR on G93A–SOD1 motoneurons. Our study suggests that selective alterations in GlyR function contribute to inhibitory insufficiency in motoneurons early in the disease process of ALS.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Inhibition of glutamine synthesis reduces astrocyte swelling and associated physiological abnormalities during acute ammonium acetate infusion in anesthetized rats. We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of glutamine accumulation during more prolonged ammonium acetate infusion in unanesthetized rats reduces cortical astrocyte swelling and immunohistochemical changes in astrocytic proteins. Rats received a continuous i.v. infusion of either sodium acetate or ammonium acetate for 24 h to increase plasma ammonia from about 30–400 μmol/l. Cohorts were pretreated with vehicle or l-methionine-S-sulfoximine (MSO; 0.83 mmol/kg). MSO reduced glutamine synthetase activity by 57% and glutamine synthetase immunopositive cell number by 69%, and attenuated cortical glutamine accumulation by 71%. Hyperammonemia increased the number of swollen astrocytes in cortex and MSO reduced this increase to control values. The number of glial fibrillary acidic protein immunopositive cells in cortex was greater in hyperammonemic rats and the increase in superficial cortical layers was attenuated by MSO. Immunoreactivity for the gap junction protein connexin-43 in the neuropil, assessed by optical density, was greater in the hyperammonemic group compared with controls, but this increase was not attenuated by MSO. No changes in the optical density of GLT1 glutamate transporter immunoreactivity in cortex were detected in any group. We conclude that glutamine synthetase inhibition reduces astrocyte swelling and ameliorates some of the reactive astroglial cytoskeletal alterations seen at 24 h of hyperammonemia, but that gap junction changes in astrocytes occur independently of glutamine accumulation and swelling.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "The mechanisms for motor neuron degeneration and regeneration in adult spinal cord following axotomy and target deprivation are not fully understood. We used a unilateral sciatic nerve avulsion model in adult rats to test the hypothesis that retrograde degeneration of motor neurons resembles apoptosis. By 21 days postlesion, the number of large motor neurons in lumbar spinal cord was reduced by ~30%. The death of motor neurons was confirmed using the terminal transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate- biotin nick-end labeling method for detecting fragmentation of nuclear DNA. Motor neuron degeneration was characterized by aberrant accumulation of perikaryal phosphorylated neurofilaments. Structurally, motor neuron death was apoptosis. Apoptotic motor neurons undergo chromatolysis followed by progressive cytoplasmic and nuclear condensation with chromatin compaction into uniformly large round clumps. Prior to apoptosis, functionally active mitochondria accumulate within chromatolytic motor neurons, as determined by cytochrome c oxidase activity. These dying motor neurons sustain oxidative damage to proteins and nucleic acids within the first 7 days after injury during the progression of apoptosis, as identified by immunodetection of nitrotyrosine and hydroxyl-modified deoxyguanosine and guanosine. We conclude that the retrograde death of motor neurons in the adult spinal cord after sciatic nerve avulsion is apoptosis. Accumulation of active mitochondria within the perikaryon and oxidative damage to nucleic acids and proteins may contribute to the mechanisms for apoptosis of motor neurons in the adult spinal cord.",

        "abstract": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 g) were injected intraperitoneally with T-2 toxin, a trichothecene mycotoxin protein synthesis inhibitor, at dosages of 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, and 6.0 mg/kg (1 LD50 = 0.9 mg/kg) before decapitation at 8-hr postexposure. Correlative data were obtained on changes in physicochemical properties of nuclear chromatin, chromatin dispersion, and nuclear volume of cerebrocortical (layer III) and striatal neurons using Feulgen-DNA (F-DNA) cytophotometry and ocular filar micrometry. Decreased lability of neurons to F-DNA acid hydrolysis (reduced F-DNA yield), nuclear shrinkage, and chromatin aggregation (decreased chromophore area) were used as indices of suppression of genomic template activity, i.e., neuronal nuclear functioning. Conversely, increased F-DNA yield, chromophore area, and nuclear volume signify enhanced neuronal activation. At 8 hr following T-2 toxin exposure, cerebrocortical and striatal neurons exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in F-DNA hydrolyzability, i.e., impaired chromatin activity, and increases in both chromatin dispersion and nuclear volume. Microscopic observation revealed no gross evidence of T-2 induced neurotoxicity. These data indicate that T-2 toxin elicits both neurochemical injury and adaptive or compensatory processes simultaneously. The toxicological importance of observed nuclear alterations and the role of impairments in central nervous system metabolism in acute T-2 toxicity remain to be ascertained.",

        "abstract": "We studied DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair capacities of skeletal muscle cells from a mouse model of infantile spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) caused by loss-of-function mutation of survival of motor neuron ( Smn ). Primary myocyte cultures derived from skeletal muscle satellite cells of neonatal control and mutant SMN mice had similar myotube length, myonuclei, satellite cell marker Pax7 and differentiated myotube marker myosin, and acetylcholine receptor clustering. DNA damage was induced in differentiated skeletal myotubes by γ-irradiation, etoposide, and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Unexposed control and SMA myotubes had stable genome integrity. After γ-irradiation and etoposide, myotubes repaired most DNA damage equally. Control and mutant myotubes exposed to MMS exhibited equivalent DNA damage without repair. Control and SMA myotube nuclei contained DDR proteins phospho-p53 and phospho-H2AX foci that, with DNA damage, dispersed and then re-formed similarly after recovery. We conclude that mouse primary satellite cell-derived myotubes effectively respond to and repair DNA strand-breaks, while DNA alkylation repair is underrepresented. Morphological differentiation, genome stability, genome sensor, and DNA strand-break repair potential are preserved in mouse SMA myocytes; thus, reduced SMN does not interfere with myocyte differentiation, genome integrity, and DNA repair, and faulty DNA repair is unlikely pathogenic in SMA.",

        "abstract": "Cardiac arrest is associated with high mortality and poor neurological outcome. We characterized functional and histological outcome in a novel mouse model of cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in order to study neuroprotective mechanisms. Cardiac arrest was induced in male C57Bl/6 and 129SVEV mice by i.v. injection of KCl. After 10 min cardiac standstill, CPR was initiated by administration of epinephrine, ventilation with 100% oxygen and chest compressions. Twenty-four hours before and 3 or 7 days after CPR, mice were subjected to behavioral testing using a passive avoidance task, locomotor activity in an open field, and spontaneous alternation in a T-maze. Hippocampal and caudoputamen injury was quantified 3 or 7 days after CPR. At both time points, caudoputamen injury was worse in 129SVEV mice. Post-ischemic mice of both strains showed a reduced number of correct choices in the T-maze up to 7 days after CPR, and were temporarily impaired in learning the passive avoidance task with a retention deficit on day 3 but not on day 7. Locomotor activity showed strain differences with C57Bl/6 mice being more active, but little ischemia-related effects. A dissociation between functional and histological outcome was found emphasizing the importance of combining both outcome measures for evaluation of neuroprotective strategies.",

        "abstract": "Myocardial nucleic acid responses were analysed in New Zealand White rabbits 20 min–1 h and 6–8 h following single subcutaneous injections of soman (20, 30, or 40 μg kg−1). Scanning‐integrating microdensitometry was used to quantify Azure B‐RNA and Feulgen–DNA (F‐DNA) levels, and changes in the suseptibility of chromatin to Feulgen acid hydrolysis (F‐DNA reactivity) of individual ventricular myocardial cells. With a dosage of 20 μg kg−1 soman, no RNA alterations were evidenced at 1 h whereas at 6–8 h myocardial cells exhibited higher RNA levels and an increase in F‐DNA reactivity of chromatin. With dosages of 30 and 40 μg kg−1 soman there was an augmentation in RNA levels and in the acid hydrolysability of nuclear chromatin at both 20 min–1 h and 6–8 h. It is postulated that the observed cellular transformations represent a compensatory augmentation in myocardial metabolic functioning presumably in response to an increased functional demand on the ventricular myocardium. The absence of cytopathic or cytochemical evidence of impairment in nucleic acid metabolism is inconsistent with the premise that soman exerts direct cytotoxic effects on rabbit myocardium.",

J. Effects of sodium fluoride on uptake of T-2 mycotoxin in cultured cells. Toxicon25, 705 – 711, 1987.—We examined the effect of sodium fluoride on uptake of tritium-labeled T-2 toxin (molecules of toxin/cell) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and African green monkey kidney (VERO) cells. Correlations were made to temperature (22 and 37°C) and toxin concentration (0.001 and 0.01 μg/ml) over time (0 – 180 min). As expected, toxin uptake increased in both cell types with increasing time and temperature. VERO cells exhibited significant (P<0.05) increases in the rate (i.e. slope) of toxin uptake under all parameters, while the rate of toxin uptake in both cell types was generally greater at 37°C compared to 22°C. The rate of equilibrium was affected by both temperature and sodium fluoride. At 37°C toxin uptake plateaued by 30 min in the presence of sodium fluoride. At 22°C the rate of toxin uptake was slower, with or without sodium fluoride present. Statistical analysis of individual time points along the curve demonstrated that sodium fluoride significantly increased cell-associated toxin at most time points. Analysis of the slopes of uptake curves from 0 to 20 min indicated significant (P<0.05) differences in the rates of T-2 uptake in both cell types and toxin doses in the presence of sodium fluoride. The increase in toxin uptake in the presence of sodium fluoride was not due to altered cell membane permeability caused by sodium fluoride. This study demonstrates that sodium fluoride significantly increases cell-associated T-2 toxin and the rate of toxin uptake in two cultured cell lines.",

        "abstract": "Cytosine methylation is an epigenetic modification of DNA catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases. Cytosine methylation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is believed to have relative underrepresentation; however, possible tissue and cell differences in mtDNA methylation and relationships to neurodegenerative disease have not been examined. We show by immunoblotting that DNA methyltransferase 3A (Dnmt3a) isoform is present in pure mitochondria of adult mouse CNS, skeletal muscle, and testes, and adult human cerebral cortex. Dnmt1 was not detected in adult mouse CNS or skeletal muscle mitochondria but appeared bound to the outer mitochondrial membrane. Immunofluorescence confirmed the mitochondrial localization of Dnmt3a and showed 5-methylcytosine (5mC) immunoreactivity in mitochondria of neurons and skeletal muscle myofibers. DNA pyrosequencing of two loci (D-loop and 16S rRNA gene) and twelve cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in mtDNA directly showed a tissue differential presence of 5mC. Because mitochondria have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but the disease mechanisms are uncertain, we evaluated mitochondrial Dnmt3a and 5mC levels in human superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) transgenic mouse models of ALS. Mitochondrial Dnmt3a protein levels were reduced significantly in skeletal muscle and spinal cord at presymptomatic or early disease. Immunofluorescence showed that 5mC immunoreactivity was present in mitochondria of neurons and skeletal myofibers, and 5mC immunoreactivity became aggregated in motor neurons of ALS mice. DNA pyrosequencing revealed significant abnormalities in 16S rRNA gene methylation in ALS mice. Immunofluorescence showed that 5mC immunoreactivity can be sequestered into autophagosomes and that mitophagy was increased and mitochondrial content was decreased in skeletal muscle in ALS mice. This study reveals a tissue-preferential mitochondrial localization of Dnmt3a and presence of cytosine methylation in mtDNA of nervous tissue and skeletal muscle and demonstrates that mtDNA methylation patterns and mitochondrial Dnmt3a levels are abnormal in skeletal muscle and spinal cord of presymptomatic ALS mice, and these abnormalities occur in parallel with loss of myofiber mitochondria.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) increases nitric oxide (NO) production in the hippocampus in vivo. Microdialysis probes were placed bilaterally into the CA3 region of the hippocampus of adult Sprague–Dawley rats under pentobarbital anesthesia. Probes were perfused for 5 h with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing 3 μM [14C]-L-arginine. Recovery of [14C]-L-citrulline in the effluent was used as a marker of NO production. In nine groups of rats, increases in [14C]-L-citrulline recovery were compared between right- and left-sided probes perfused with various combinations of the selective mGluR agonist, trans-(1S,3R)-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (ACPD); the mGluR antagonist, (±)-α-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG); the NO synthase inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine (LNNA); the ryanodine sensitive calcium-release channel inhibitor dantrolene, the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA); receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX); the NMDA receptor antagonist (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d] cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK-801); and the Na+ channel blocker, tetrodotoxin. Recovery of [14C]-L-citrulline during perfusion with artificial CSF progressively increased to 90 ± 21 fmol/min (± SD) over 5 h. Perfusion in the contralateral hippocampus with 1 mM ACPD augmented [14C]-L-citrulline recovery to 250 ± 81 fmol/min. Perfusion of 1 mM nitroarginine + ACPD inhibited [14C]-L-citrulline recovery compared to that with ACPD alone. Perfusion with 1 mM MCPG + ACPD attenuated ACPD enhanced [14C]-L-citrulline recovery. Perfusion of 1 mM dantrolene + ACPD inhibited the ACPD-evoked increase in [14C]-L-citrulline recovery. Perfusion of 1 mM MCPG or dantrolene without ACPD did not decrease [14C]-L-citrulline recovery as compared to CSF alone. ACPD-enhanced [14C]-L-citrulline recovery was not attenuated by CNQX, MK-801, or tetrodotoxin (TTX). Using an indirect method of assessing NO production in vivo, these data demonstrate that mGluR stimulation enhances NO production in rat hippocampus. Inhibition with dantrolene suggests that calcium-induced calcium release amplifies the inositol triphosphate-mediated calcium signal associated with mGluR stimulation, thereby resulting in augmented calcium-dependent NO production.",

        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also referred to as motor neurone disease, is a fatal neurological disease that is characterized clinically by progressive muscle weakness, muscle atrophy, and eventual paralysis. The neuropathology of ALS is primary degeneration of upper (motor cortical) and lower (brainstem and spinal) motor neurons. The amyotrophy refers to the neurogenic atrophy of affected muscle groups, and the lateral sclerosis refers to the hardening of the lateral white matter funiculus in spinal cord (corresponding to degeneration of the corticospinal tract) found at autopsy. Because the mechanisms for the motor neuron degeneration in ALS are not understood, this disease has no precisely known causes and no effective treatments. Very recent studies have identified that the degeneration of motor neurons in ALS is a form of apoptotic cell death that may occur by an abnormal programmed cell death (PCD) mechanism. In order to treat ALS effectively, we need to understand the mechanisms for motor neuron apoptosis more completely. Future studies need to further identify the signals for PCD activation in neurons as they relate to the pathogenesis of ALS and to clarify the molecular pathways leading to motor neuron apoptosis in animal and cell culture model systems. These studies should lead to a better understanding of motor neuron death and to the design of new therapeutic experiments critical for the future treatment of ALS.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the third most common adult-onset neurodegenerative disease. It causes the degeneration of motoneurons and is fatal due to paralysis, particularly of respiratory muscles. ALS can be inherited, and specific disease-causing genes have been identified, but the mechanisms causing motoneuron death in ALS are not understood. No effective treatments exist for ALS. One well-studied theory of ALS pathogenesis involves faulty RNA editing and abnormal activation of specific glutamate receptors as well as failure of glutamate transport resulting in glutamate excitotoxicity; however, the excitotoxicity theory is challenged by the inability of anti-glutamate drugs to have major disease-modifying effects clinically. Nevertheless, hyperexcitability of upper and lower motoneurons is a feature of human ALS and transgenic (tg) mouse models of ALS. Motoneuron excitability is strongly modulated by synaptic inhibition mediated by presynaptic glycinergic and GABAergic innervations and postsynaptic glycine receptors (GlyR) and GABAA receptors; yet, the integrity of inhibitory systems regulating motoneurons has been understudied in experimental models, despite findings in human ALS suggesting that they may be affected. We have found in tg mice expressing a mutant form of human superoxide dismutase-1 (hSOD1) with a Gly93 → Ala substitution (G93A-hSOD1), causing familial ALS, that subsets of spinal interneurons degenerate. Inhibitory glycinergic innervation of spinal motoneurons becomes deficient before motoneuron degeneration is evident in G93A-hSOD1 mice. Motoneurons in these ALS mice also have insufficient synaptic inhibition as reflected by smaller GlyR currents, smaller GlyR clusters on their plasma membrane, and lower expression of GlyR1α mRNA compared to wild-type motoneurons. In contrast, GABAergic innervation of ALS mouse motoneurons and GABAA receptor function appear normal. Abnormal synaptic inhibition resulting from dysfunction of interneurons and motoneuron GlyRs is a new direction for unveiling mechanisms of ALS pathogenesis that could be relevant to new therapies for ALS.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) reared during the first year of life without social contact develop persistent stereotyped movements, self- directed behaviors, and psychosocial abnormalities, but neurobiological mechanisms underlying the behaviors of socially deprived (SD) monkeys are unknown. Monkeys were reared in total social deprivation for the first 9 months of life; control monkeys were reared socially (SR) with mothers and peers. Subjects were killed at 19-24 yr of age. Because the behaviors of SD monkeys are reminiscent of changes in striatal or amygdalar function, we used immunocytochemistry for substance P (SP), leucine-enkephalin (LENK), somatostatin, calbindin, and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) to evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively patterns of neurotransmitter marker immunoreactivity within subcortical regions. In SD monkeys, the chemoarchitecture of the striatum was altered. Neuronal cell bodies and processes immunoreactive for SP and LENK were depleted markedly in patch (striosome) and matrix regions of the caudate nucleus and putamen; the average density of SP-immunoreactive neurons was reduced 58% relative to SR monkeys. Calbindin and TH immunoreactivities were diminished in the matrix of caudate and putamen of SD monkeys. TH-immunoreactive neurons, but not cresyl violet-stained neurons, in the substantia nigra pars compacta were decreased (43%) in SD monkeys. Peptide-immunoreactive terminals were reduced in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra in SD monkeys. The nucleus accumbens was the least affected of striatal regions. Striatal somatostatin immunoreactivity wa qualitatively and quantitatively similar in SD and SR monkeys. Several regions, for example, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, and basal forebrain magnocellular complex, that were in the same sections and are enriched in these markers did not appear altered in SD monkeys, suggesting a regional specificity for vulnerability. The altered chemoarchitecture of some basal ganglia regions in adult monkeys that experienced social deprivation as infants suggests that the postnatal maturation of neurotransmitter phenotypes in some structures is influenced by social environment. Abnormal motor and psychosocial behaviors resulting from this form of social/sensory deprivation may result from alterations in peptidergic and dopaminergic systems within the basal ganglia.",

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are the most common human adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. They are characterized by prominent age-related neurodegeneration in selectively vulnerable neural systems. Some forms of AD, PD, and ALS are inherited, and genes causing these diseases have been identified. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of the neuronal degeneration in these familial diseases, and in the more common idiopathic (sporadic) diseases, are unresolved. Genetic, biochemical, and morphological analyses of human AD, PD, and ALS, as well as their cell and animal models, reveal that mitochondria could have roles in this neurodegeneration. The varied functions and properties of mitochondria might render subsets of selectively vulnerable neurons intrinsically susceptible to cellular aging and stress and the overlying genetic variations. In AD, alterations in enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative damage, and mitochondrial binding of Aβ and amyloid precursor protein have been reported. In PD, mutations in mitochondrial proteins have been identified and mitochondrial DNA mutations have been found in neurons in the substantia nigra. In ALS, changes occur in mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes and mitochondrial programmed cell death proteins. Transgenic mouse models of human neurodegenerative disease are beginning to reveal possible principles governing the biology of selective neuronal vulnerability that implicate mitochondria and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. This chapter reviews several aspects of mitochondrial biology and how mitochondrial pathobiology might contribute to the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in AD, PD, and ALS.",

        "abstract": "Patterns of immunoreactivity for calcium-binding protein, tyrosine hydroxylase and four neuropeptides in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle and ventromedial parts of the caudate nucleus and putamen) were compared to patterns of these markers in the dorsal striatum (the majority of the neostriatum) in rhesus monkey. The striatal mosaic was delineated by calcium-binding protein and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivities. Both markers were found preferentially in the matrix of the dorsal striatum. The mosaic configurations of tyrosine hydroxylase, but not calcium-binding protein immunoreactivity, were similar in dorsal and ventral striatal regions. Substance P and leucine-enkephalin were not distributed homogeneously; distinct types and the prevalence of patches of substance P and leucine-enkephalin immunoreactivity distinguish the dorsal striatum from the ventral striatum and distinguish the caudate nucleus from the putamen. In the dorsal striatum, substance P and leucine-enkephalin patches consist of dense islands of immunoreactive neurons and puncta or clusters of immunoreactive neurons marginated by a dense rim of terminal-like puncta; the matrix was also enriched in leucine-enkephalin-immunoreactive neurons but contained less substance P-immunoreactive neurons. Patches were more prominent in the caudate nucleus than in the putamen. In the caudate, compartments low in tyrosine hydroxylase and calcium-binding protein immunoreactivities corresponded to cytologically identified cell islands and to patches enriched in substance P and leucine-enkephalin. These patches had a discrete infrastructure based on the location of substance P and leucine-enkephalin-immunoreactive neurons and terminals. In the ventral striatum, patches that showed low levels of substance P and leucine-enkephalin immunoreactivities were embedded in a matrix rich in immunoreactive cell bodies, fibers and terminals. In the accumbens, regions showing little tyrosine hydroxylase were in spatial register with patches low in substance P and leucine-enkephalin. Neurotensin- and somatostatin-immunoreactive neurons or processes were also compartmentally organized, particularly in the ventral striatum. Neurotensin-immunoreactive neurons were present predominantly in the nucleus accumbens but not in the dorsal striatum. Some regions enriched in neurotensin immunoreactivity were spatially registered with zones low in tyrosine hydroxylase, substance P and zones enriched in leucine-enkephalin. Areas enriched in somatostatin-immunoreactive processes overlapped with both tyrosine hydroxylase-rich and -poor regions in the ventral striatum.",

        "abstract": "Neurological deficits in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, even with therapeutic hypothermia, are partially attributed to white matter injury. We theorized that proteasome insufficiency contributes to white matter injury. Methods and Results Neonatal piglets received hypoxia-ischemia ( HI ) or sham procedure with normothermia, hypothermia, or hypothermia+rewarming. Some received a proteasome activator drug (oleuropein) or white matter-targeted, virus-mediated proteasome knockdown. We measured myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, proteasome subunit 20S (P20S), proteasome activity, and carbonylated and ubiquitinated protein levels in white matter and cerebral cortex. HI reduced myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein levels regardless of temperature, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein loss was associated with increased ubiquitinated and carbonylated protein levels. Ubiquitinated and carbonyl-damaged proteins increased in white matter 29 hours after HI during hypothermia to exceed levels at 6 to 20 hours. In cortex, ubiquitinated proteins decreased. Ubiquitinated and carbonylated protein accumulation coincided with lower P20S levels in white matter; P20S levels also decreased in cerebral cortex. However, proteasome activity in white matter lagged behind that in cortex 29 hours after HI during hypothermia. Systemic oleuropein enhanced white matter P20S and protected the myelin, whereas proteasome knockdown exacerbated myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein loss and ubiquitinated protein accumulation after HI . At the cellular level, temperature and HI interactively affected macroglial P20S enrichment in subcortical white matter. Rewarming alone increased macroglial P20S immunoreactivity, but this increase was blocked by HI . Conclusions Oxidized and ubiquitinated proteins accumulate with HI -induced white matter injury. Proteasome insufficiency may drive this injury. Hypothermia did not prevent myelin damage, protect the proteasome, or preserve oxidized and ubiquitinated protein clearance after HI .",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Quantitative azure B-RNA cytophotometry was employed to compare effects of the oximes HI-6 and pralidoxime (2-PAM) to those of atropine sulfate (AS) on neruronal RNA metabolism in the thalamic ventrobasal nuclear complex (VBC) and nucleus reticularis (NR). The ability of these compounds to mitigate soman (pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate)-induced neuronal RNA alterations (i.e., VBC-RNA depletion/NR-RNA elevation) in these muscarinic cholinergic sites was also determined. Generally, HI-6 (125 mg/kg, i.p.) and 2-PAM (43.2 mg/kg, i.m.) elicited similar patterns of neuronal RNA changes, i.e., diminution of VBC-RNA and NR-RNA with oximes alone; partial amelioration of soman (1.5 LD50, s.c.)-induced VBC-RNA loss; and slight or no effect on soman induced NR-RNA accumulation. HI-6 produced more severe RNA reduction than 2-PAM in both brain regions of non-poisoned rats, whereas 2-PAM was more effective in reversing the effects of soman in these two regions. The muscarinic antagonist, AS, also produced VBC-RNA depletion and partially counteracted the VBC-RNA loss in soman intoxicated rats. Unlike the oximes, however, AS resulted in NR-RNA accumulation and it also antagonized soman induced NR-RNA elevation. Neither oxime reactivated soman inhibited brain acetylcholinesterase but HI-6 did reactivate appreciable plasma cholinesterase. The overall data suggest that HI-6 and 2-PAM do exert pharmacologic actions on cholinergic neurons in the rat CNS. However, the greater effectiveness of HI-6 over 2-PAM in countering lethal actions of soman does not appear to be correlated with oxime mediated restoration of neuronal RNA levels in these two cholinergic regions. Thus, not central cholinergic actions, but peripheral effects of oximes, such as cholinesterase reactivation, may be crucial for antidotal protection.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "The basal ganglia of newborns are extremely vulnerable to hypoxic ischemia (HI). Striatal neurons undergo prominent necrosis after HI. The mechanisms for this degeneration are not well understood. Postasphyxic hypothermia ameliorates the striatal necrosis, but the mechanisms of hypothermia-induced neuroprotection are not known. We used a newborn piglet model of hypoxic-asphyxic cardiac arrest to test the hypotheses that N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation and free radical damage coexist, prior to neurodegeneration, early after resuscitation, and that these changes are attenuated with hypothermia. Piglets were subjected to 30 min of hypoxia followed by 7 min of airway occlusion, causing asphyxic cardiac arrest, and then were resuscitated and survived normothermically for 5 min, 3 h, or 6 h, or hypothermically for 3 h. By 6 h of normothermic recovery, 50% of neurons in putamen showed ischemic cytopathology. Striatal tissue was fractionated into membrane or soluble proteins and was assayed by immunoblotting for carbonyl modification, phosphorylation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor subunit NR1, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Significant accumulation of soluble protein carbonyls was present at 3 h (196% of control) and 6 h (142% of control). Phosphorylation of serine-897 of NR1 was increased significantly at 5 min (161% of control) and 3 h (226% of control) after HI. Phosphorylation of serine-890 of NR1 was also increased after HI. Membrane-associated neuronal nitric oxide synthase was increased by 35% at 5 min. Hypothermia attenuated the oxidative damage and the NR1 phosphorylation in striatum. We conclude that neuronal death signaling in newborn striatum after HI is engaged rapidly through N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation, neuronal nitric oxide synthase recruitment, and oxidative stress. Postasphyxic, mild whole body hypothermia provides neuroprotection by suppressing N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor phosphorylation and protein oxidation.",

        "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is tasked, among many other functions, with preventing excitotoxicity from killing neurons following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI). With the search for delayed therapies to treat neonatal HI, the study of delayed ER responses becomes relevant. We hypothesized that ER stress is a prominent feature of delayed neuronal death via programmed necrosis after neonatal HI. Since necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), an inhibitor of programmed necrosis, provides delayed neuroprotection against neonatal HI in male mice, Nec-1 is an ideal tool to study delayed ER responses. C57B6 male mice were exposed to right carotid ligation followed by exposure to FiO2 = 0.08 for 45 min at p7. Mice were treated with vehicle or Nec-1 (0.1 μl of 8 μmol) intracerebroventricularly with age-matched littermates as controls. Biochemistry assays at 3 and 24 h and electron microscopy (EM) and immunohistochemistry at 96 h after HI were performed. EM showed ER dilation and mitochondrial swelling as apparent early changes in neurons. With advanced neurodegeneration, large cytoplasmic fragments containing dilated ER “shed” into the surrounding neuropil and calreticulin immunoreactivity was lost concurrent with nuclear features suggestive of programmed necrosis. Nec-1 attenuated biochemical markers of ER stress after neonatal HI, including PERK and eIF2α phosphorylation, and unconventional XBP-1 splicing, consistent with the mitigation of later ER pathology. ER pathology may be an indicator of severity of neuronal injury and potential for recovery characterized by cytoplasmic shedding, distinct from apoptotic blebbing, that we term neuronal macrozeiosis. Therapies to attenuate ER stress applied at delayed stages may rescue stressed neurons after neonatal HI.",

        "abstract": "We used the fimbria-fornix (FF) transection model of axonal injury to test the hypothesis that transneuronal degeneration occurs in the adult central nervous system in response to deafferentation. The medial mammillary nucleus, pars medialis (MMNm) was analyzed by light and electron microscopy at 3, 7, 14, and 30 days, and 6 months after unilateral FF transection in adult rat to identify the time course of neuronal responses in a remote target. Presynaptic terminals and neuronal cell bodies degenerated in the MMNm ipsilateral to FF transection. Terminal degeneration occurred predominantly at 3 and 7 days postlesion. Between 14 and 30 days postlesion, neuronal number in the MMNm decreased (~20%). Two forms of neuronal degeneration were found in the MMNm after deafferentation. Some neurons died apoptotically. Other neurons underwent vacuolar degeneration. In these latter neurons, somatodendritic pathology occurred at 14 and 30 days and 6 months postlesion. The ultrastructure of this vacuolar degeneration was characterized by disorganization of the cytoplasm, formation of membrane-bound vacuolar cisternae and membranous inclusions, loss of organelles, cytoplasmic pallor, and chromatin alterations. This study shows that both anterograde axonal degeneration and transneuronal degeneration occur in a fornical target after FF axon transection.

        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid deposits and evidence of dysfunction/death of specific populations of nerve cells. The clinical phenotype (i.e. amnesia, dementia) reflects these processes. To clarify etiological factors, pathogenetic mechanisms, and potential therapeutic approaches, investigators have turned to the development of model systems, and we focus on studies of amyloidogenesis and strategies to attenuate experimentally induced degeneration of specific populations of neurons. Aspects of the normal and abnormal biology of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and APP homologues have been clarified by immunocytochemistry showing the distribution of the protein and by ligation/labeling paradigms demonstrating that APP and amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) are rapidly transported in axons. These approaches permit the examination of APP processing in vivo. Moreover, gene targeting strategies can be used to ablate APP and APLP2 genes and to clarify some of the functions of these molecules. Recent animal model studies have been designed to clarify the roles of age and genes as etiological factors. Age as a factor is best illustrated by studies of the aged nonhuman primate, which develops memory deficits and brain pathology, including amyloid deposits, senile plaques, and degenerative changes in neurons and the formation of neurites, often in proximity to Aβ deposits. Genetic factors have begun to be modeled by transgenic strategies (i.e. conventional cDNA and yeast artificial chromosome-embryonic stem cell methods) that have created mice expressing the human APP gene with/without AD-linked APP mutations. Neurotrophic therapies are a novel approach used to promote the survival of vulnerable populations of neurons, including basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and anterior thalamic limbic-cortical cells. Both of these populations of neurons can be influenced by neurotrophic factors, and nerve growth factor, acting on basal forebrain neurons, is efficacious in attenuating memory deficits in aged rodents.",

        "abstract": "Neurologic morbidity remains high in neonates with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury despite therapeutic hypothermia. DTI provides qualitative and quantitative information about the microstructure of the brain, and a near-infrared spectroscopy index can assess cerebrovascular autoregulation. We hypothesized that lower ADC values would correlate with worse autoregulatory function. Thirty-one neonates with hypoxic-ischemic injury were enrolled. ADC scalars were measured in 27 neonates (age range, 4–15 days) in the anterior and posterior centrum semiovale, basal ganglia, thalamus, posterior limb of the internal capsule, pons, and middle cerebellar peduncle on MRI obtained after completion of therapeutic hypothermia. The blood pressure range of each neonate with the most robust autoregulation was identified by using a near-infrared spectroscopy index. Autoregulatory function was measured by blood pressure deviation below the range with optimal autoregulation. In neonates who had MRI on day of life ≥10, lower ADC scalars in the posterior centrum semiovale (r = −0.87, P = .003, n = 9) and the posterior limb of the internal capsule (r = −0.68, P = .04, n = 9) correlated with blood pressure deviation below the range with optimal autoregulation during hypothermia. Lower ADC scalars in the basal ganglia correlated with worse autoregulation during rewarming (r = −0.71, P = .05, n = 8). Blood pressure deviation from the optimal autoregulatory range may be an early biomarker of injury in the posterior centrum semiovale, posterior limb of the internal capsule, and basal ganglia. Optimizing blood pressure to support autoregulation may decrease the risk of brain injury in cooled neonates with hypoxic-ischemic injury.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Ablation of mouse occipital cortex induces precisely timed and uniform p53-modulated and Bax-dependent apoptosis of thalamocortical projection neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) by 7 d after lesion. We tested the hypothesis that this neuronal apoptosis is initiated by oxidative stress and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Preapoptotic LGN neurons accumulate mitochondria, Zn2+ and Ca2+, and generate higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide, nitric oxide (NO), and peroxynitrite, than LGN neurons with an intact cortical target. Preapoptosis of LGN neurons is associated with increased formation of protein carbonyls, protein nitration, and protein S-nitrosylation. Genetic deletion of nitric oxide synthase 1 (nos1) and inhibition of NOS1 with nitroindazole protected LGN neurons from apoptosis, revealing NO as a mediator. Putative components of the mPTP are expressed in mouse LGN, including the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), and cyclophilin D (CyPD). Nitration of CyPD and ANT in LGN mitochondria occurs by 2 d after cortical injury. Chemical cross-linking showed that LGN neuron preapoptosis is associated with formation of CyPD and VDAC oligomers, consistent with mPTP formation. Mice without CyPD are rescued from neuron apoptosis as are mice treated with the mPTP inhibitors TRO-19622 (cholest-4-en-3-one oxime) and TAT-Bcl-XL-BH4. Manipulation of the mPTP markedly attenuated the early preapoptotic production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species in target-deprived neurons. Our results demonstrate in adult mouse brain neurons that the mPTP functions to enhance ROS production and the mPTP and NO trigger apoptosis; thus, the mPTP is a target for neuroprotection in vivo.",

        "abstract": "The cerebral cortices of macaques (ranging in age from 10 to 37 years; n = 17) were analyzed by immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy to determine the cellular and subcellular localizations of the amyloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid protein, the cellular participants in the formation of senile plaques and parenchymal deposits of the beta-amyloid protein, and the temporal/spatial development of these lesions. Amyloid precursor protein was enriched within the cytoplasm of pyramidal and nonpyramidal neuronal cell bodies in young and old monkeys. In the neuropil, amyloid precursor protein was most abundant within dendrites and dendritic spines; few axons, axonal terminals, and resting astrocytes and microglia contained the amyloid precursor protein. At synapses, amyloid precursor protein was found predominantly within postsynaptic elements and was enriched at postsynaptic densities of asymmetrical synapses. The earliest morphological change related to senile plaque formation was an age-related abnormality in the cortical neuropil characterized by the formation of dense bodies within presynaptic terminals and dendrites and an augmented localization of the amyloid precursor protein to astrocytes and microglia. In most monkeys > 26 years of age, the neocortical parenchyma exhibited neuritic pathology and plaques characterized by swollen cytoplasmic processes, interspersed somata of neurons, and reactive glia within or at the periphery of senile plaques. Neurites and reactive astrocytes and microglia within these plaques were enriched with the amyloid precursor protein. In diffuse plaques, nonfibrillar beta-amyloid protein immunoreactivity was visualized within cytoplasmic lysosomes of neuronal perikarya and dendrites and the cell bodies and processes of activated astrocytes and microglia. In mature plaques, beta-amyloid protein immunoreactivity was associated with extracellular fibrils within the parenchyma; some cytoplasmic membranes of degenerating dendrites and somata as well as processes of activated glia showed diffuse intracellular beta-amyloid protein immunoreactivity. We conclude that morphological abnormalities at synapses (including changes in both pre- and postsynaptic elements) precede the accumulation of the amyloid precursor protein within neurites and activated astrocytes and microglia as well as the deposition of extracellular fibrillar beta-amyloid protein; neuronal perikarya/dendrites and reactive glia containing the amyloid precursor protein are primary sources of the beta-amyloid protein within senile plaques; and nonfibrillar beta-amyloid protein exists intracellularly within neurons and nonneuronal cells prior to the appearance of extracellular deposits of the beta-amyloid protein and the formation of beta-pleated fibrils",

        "abstract": "The authors used cultured mouse cortical neurons to study mechanisms of DNA damage-induced apoptosis in immature and mature neurons. Neurons were maintained viably for 60 days in vitro (DIV60). The increased levels of glutamate receptors, synaptic proteins, and glycolytic enzyme were used to track maturation. Exposure of neurons to the DNA-damaging agent camptothecin induced apoptosis in immature (DIV5) and mature (DIV25–30) neurons. Internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA emerged more rapidly in mature neurons than in immature neurons. Immunoblotting revealed that cleaved caspase-3 increased in apoptotic DIV5 neurons but not in DIV30 neurons, but immunolocalization showed accumulation of cleaved caspase-3 in DIV5 and DIV30 neurons. A reversible caspase-3 inhibitor blocked apoptosis in DIV5 neurons but not in DIV30 neurons. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Erk/MAP kinase)-42/44 occurred preapoptotically in mature but not immature neurons, while Erk54 nuclear translocation and MAP kinase kinase kinase-1 cleavage into putative caspase-3–generated proapoptotic fragments occurred in DIV5 but not DIV30 neurons. Inhibition of Erk activation with MAP kinase kinase inhibitor blocked apoptosis at both ages. The results show that immature and mature cortical neurons engage different signaling mechanisms in MAP kinase and caspase pathways during apoptosis; thus, neuron age influences the mechanisms and progression of apoptosis.",

        "abstract": "DNA damage is a form of cell stress and injury that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurologic disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Down syndrome, Parkinson disease, cerebral ischemia, and head trauma. However, most data reveal only associations, and the role for DNA damage in direct mechanisms of neurodegeneration is vague with respect to being a definitive upstream cause of neuron cell death, rather than a consequence of the degeneration. Although neurons seem inclined to develop DNA damage during oxidative stress, most of the existing work on DNA damage and repair mechanisms has been done in the context of cancer biology using cycling nonneuronal cells but not nondividing (i.e. postmitotic) neurons. Nevertheless, the identification of mutations in genes that encode proteins that function in DNA repair and DNA damage response in human hereditary DNA repair deficiency syndromes and ataxic disorders is establishing a mechanistic precedent that clearly links DNA damage and DNA repair abnormalities with progressive neurodegeneration. This review summarizes DNA damage and repair mechanisms and their potential relevance to the evolution of degeneration in postmitotic neurons.",

Quantitative cytophotometric analysis of brain neuronal RNA and protein changes in acute T-2 mycotoxin poisoned rats. Toxicon24, 933 – 941, 1986.—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 g) injected intraperitoneally with T-2 toxin, a trichothecene mycotoxin protein synthesis inhibitor, at dosages of 0.75, 1.0, 1.5 and 6.0 mg/kg (1LD50= 0.9 mg/kg) were decapitated at 8 hr post-exposure. Data were obtained on changes in neuronal (perikaryal) RNA levels, protein contents and nucleolar volumes in cerebrocortical (layer III) and striatal (caudate - putamen) brain regions using quantitative azure B - RNA and Coomassie - protein cytophotometry and ocular filar micrometry. Correlative observations were made on changes in brain cytomorphology. Reductions in neuronal RNA/protein contents and nucleolar volume were used as indices of impaired perikaryal functioning. At 8 hr after T-2 toxin poisoning the following results were obtained in cerebrocortical and striatal brain compartments: (1) neuronal RNA contents were generally maintained at control values in both brain regions, however, moderate RNA depletion was evidenced in the cerebral cortex with 1.5 mg/kg T-2 and in the striatum with a 6.0 mg/kg dose; (2) neuronal protein levels were suppressed in a dose-dependent fashion within the cerebrocortex, while in the striatum there was no direct correspondence between protein loss and T-2 dosage; (3) neuronal nucleolar volumes were typically maintained at control levels in both neuronal compartments. Microscopic observations revealed no gross evidence of T-2-induced brain cytopathology. These data indicate that T-2 toxin does not elicit direct cytopathic actions in these two brain regions, thus indicating that cerebrocortical and striatal compartments do not represent primary target sites of T-2 toxicant action. It is believed that neuronal protein depletion in these brain regions is more likely attributable to systemic effects of T-2 mycotoxin leading to cardiovascular insufficiency and hypoxemia.",

Time- and dose-dependent RNA responses were related to the extent of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inactivation of these 2 brain regions and to overt behavioral manifestations of toxication. A complex pattern of RNA responses was evidenced, with RNA depletion occuring at both arousal and convulsive doses of soman. In general, RNA changes paralleled previously reported metabolic responses observed in soman toxicated rats and mice: (1) linear dose-dependent suppression of RNA was evidenced during the depressant phase but not in the acute excitatory phase of toxication; and (2) RNA depletion was more severe following than during the appearance of excitatory symptoms. These data indicate that soman poisoning results in metabolic correlates of impaired rather than excessive CNS activation. It is postulated that metabolic disturbances are related to blockade of central cholinergic excitation, and that disruption of functionally integrated synaptic activity forms a critically important aspect of toxication.",

In addition, plasma cholinesterase (ChE) activity was measured to determine the extent of peripheral enzyme reactivation. Antidotal pretreatment effected complete (HI-6) or partial (AS) amelioration of neuronal RNA depletion evidenced following 1.5 LD50 (195 μg/kg) soman, whereas combined HI-6 + AS treatment only partially restored (cortical) or did not change (striatal) neuron RNA contents. HI-6 produced appreaciable plasma ChE reactivation but brain AChE activity was not significantly altered. In rats treated only with antidotes, HI-6 or AS alone significantly reduced neuronal RNA in both brain regions. These data indicate that HI-6 influences the metabolic status of central cholinergic compartments and can completely protect against soman-induced neuronal RNA depletion. However, there are no precise relationships among RNA restitution, AChE reactivation or the protective potency of antidotal treatments. Effects of HI-6 on neuronal RNA may signify central cholinolytic activity in vivo, but indirect effects mediated by peripheral mechanisms can not be excluded at present.",

        "abstract": "Neonatal hypoxic ischemic (HI) brain injury causes lifelong neurologic disability. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is the only approved therapy that partially mitigates mortality and morbidity. Therapies specifically targeting HI-induced brain cell death are currently lacking. Intracellular calcium dysregulation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction through the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) are drivers of HI cellular injury. GNX-4728, a small molecule direct inhibitor of the mPTP that increases mitochondrial calcium retention capacity, is highly effective in adult neurodegenerative disease models and could have potential as a therapy in neonatal HI. A dose of GNX-4728, equivalent to that used in animal models, 300 mg/kg, IP was highly toxic in p10 mice. We then tested the hypothesis that acute administration of 30 mg/kg, IP of GNX-4728 immediately after HI in a neonatal mouse model would provide neuroprotection. This non-lethal lower dose of GNX-4728 (30 mg/kg, IP) improved the respiratory control ratio of neonatal female HI brain tissue but not in males. Brain injury, assessed histologically with a novel metric approach at 1 and 30 days after HI, was not mitigated by GNX-4728. Our work demonstrates that a small molecule inhibitor of the mPTP has i) an age related toxicity, ii) a sex-related brain mitoprotective profile after HI but iii) this is not sufficient to attenuate forebrain HI neuropathology.",

        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease is caused by a selective loss of motor neurons. One form of juvenile onset autosomal recessive ALS (ALS2) has been linked to the loss of function of the ALS2 gene. The pathogenic mechanism of ALS2-deficiency, however, remains unclear. To further understand the function of alsin that is encoded by the full-length ALS2 gene, we screened proteins interacting with alsin. Here, we report that alsin interacted with glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1) both in vitro and in vivo, and colocalized with GRIP1 in neurons. In support of the physiological interaction between alsin and GRIP1, the subcellular distribution of GRIP1 was altered in ALS2 −/− spinal motor neurons, which correlates with a significant reduction of AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit 2 (GluR2) at the synaptic/cell surface of ALS2 −/− neurons. The decrease of calcium-impermeable GluR2-containing AMPA receptors at the cell/synaptic surface rendered ALS2 −/− neurons more susceptible to glutamate receptor-mediated neurotoxicity. Our findings reveal a novel function of alsin in AMPA receptor trafficking and provide a novel pathogenic link between ALS2-deficiency and motor neuron degeneration, suggesting a protective role of alsin in maintaining the survival of motor neurons.",

The BLSA is supported by the National Institute of Aging (NIA) and its mission is to learn what happens to people as they get old and how to sort out changes due to aging from those due to disease or other causes. In 1986, an autopsy program combined with comprehensive neurologic and cognitive evaluations was established in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC). Since then, 211 subjects have undergone autopsy. Here we review the key clinical neuropathological correlations from this autopsy series. The focus is on the morphological and biochemical changes that occur in normal aging, and the early neuropathological changes of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). We highlight the combined clinical, pathologic, morphometric, and biochemical evidence of asymptomatic AD, a state characterized by normal clinical evaluations in subjects with abundant AD pathology. We conclude that in some individuals, successful cognitive aging results from compensatory mechanisms that occur at the neuronal level (i.e., neuronal hypertrophy and synaptic plasticity) whereas a failure of compensation may culminate in disease.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the third most common adult-onset neurodegenerative disease. A diagnosis is fatal owing to degeneration of motor neurons in brain and spinal cord that control swallowing, breathing, and movement. ALS can be inherited, but most cases are not associated with a family history of the disease. The mechanisms causing motor neuron death in ALS are still unknown. Given the suspected complex interplay between multiple genes, the environment, metabolism, and lifestyle in the pathogenesis of ALS, we have hypothesized that the mechanisms of disease in ALS involve epigenetic contributions that can drive motor neuron degeneration. DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism for gene regulation engaged by DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt)-catalyzed methyl group transfer to carbon-5 in cytosine residues in gene regulatory promoter and nonpromoter regions. Recent genome-wide analyses have found differential gene methylation in human ALS. Neuropathologic assessments have revealed that motor neurons in human ALS show significant abnormalities in Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and 5-methylcytosine. Similar changes are seen in mice with motor neuron degeneration, and Dnmt3a was found abundantly at synapses and in mitochondria. During apoptosis of cultured motor neuron-like cells, Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a protein levels increase, and 5-methylcytosine accumulates. Enforced expression of Dnmt3a, but not Dnmt1, induces degeneration of cultured neurons. Truncation mutation of the Dnmt3a catalytic domain and Dnmt3a RNAi blocks apoptosis of cultured neurons. Inhibition of Dnmt catalytic activity with small molecules RG108 and procainamide protects motor neurons from excessive DNA methylation and apoptosis in cell culture and in a mouse model of ALS. Thus, motor neurons can engage epigenetic mechanisms to cause their degeneration, involving Dnmts and increased DNA methylation. Aberrant DNA methylation in vulnerable cells is a new direction for discovering mechanisms of ALS pathogenesis that could be relevant to new disease target identification and therapies for ALS.",

Flies with a deleted APPL gene are viable and have a defective fast phototaxis response, a behavior that is partially rescued by the introduction of human APP cDNA.

        "abstract": "DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism for gene silencing engaged by DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt)-catalyzed methyl group transfer to cytosine residues in gene-regulatory regions. It is unknown whether aberrant DNA methylation can cause neurodegeneration. We tested the hypothesis that Dnmts can mediate neuronal cell death. Enforced expression of Dnmt3a induced degeneration of cultured NSC34 cells. During apoptosis of NSC34 cells induced by camptothecin, levels of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a increased fivefold and twofold, respectively, and 5-methylcytosine accumulated in nuclei. Truncation mutation of the Dnmt3a catalytic domain and Dnmt3a RNAi blocked apoptosis of cultured neurons. Inhibition of Dnmt catalytic activity with RG108 and procainamide protected cultured neurons from excessive DNA methylation and apoptosis. In vivo, Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a are expressed differentially during mouse brain and spinal cord maturation and in adulthood when Dnmt3a is abundant in synapses and mitochondria. Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a are expressed in motor neurons of adult mouse spinal cord, and, during their apoptosis induced by sciatic nerve avulsion, nuclear and cytoplasmic 5-methylcytosine immunoreactivity, Dnmt3a protein levels and Dnmt enzyme activity increased preapoptotically. Inhibition of Dnmts with RG108 blocked completely the increase in 5-methycytosine and the apoptosis of motor neurons in mice. In human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), motor neurons showed changes in Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and 5-methylcytosine similar to experimental models. Thus, motor neurons can engage epigenetic mechanisms to drive apoptosis, involving Dnmt upregulation and increased DNA methylation. These cellular mechanisms could be relevant to human ALS pathobiology and disease treatment.",

        "abstract": "Mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) and presenilin 2 (PS2) genes can cause Alzheimer's disease in affected members of the majority of early-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) pedigrees1–7. PS1 encodes an ubiquitously expressed, eight transmembrane protein1,8–11. PS1 is endoproteolytically processed to an amino-terminal derivative (∼27–28 kDa) and a carboxy-terminal derivative (∼17–18 kDa). These polypeptides accumulate to saturable levels in the brains of transgenic mice, independent of the expression of PS1 holoprotein12. We now document that, in the brains of transgenic mice, the absolute amounts of accumulated N- and C-terminal derivatives generated from the FAD-linked PS1 variants in which Glu replaces Ala at codon 246 (A246E) or Leu replaces Met at codon 146 (M146L) accumulate to a significantly higher degree (∼40–50%) than the fragments derived from wild-type PS1. Moreover, the FAD-linked ΔE9 PS1 variant, a polypeptide that is not subject to endoproteolytic cleavage in vivo, also accumulates in greater amounts than the fragments generated from wild-type human PS1. Thus, the metabolism of PS1 variants linked to FAD is fundamentally different from that of wild-type PS1 in vivo.",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "Glutamate transport is a primary mechanism for regulating extracellular levels of glutamate in the central nervous system. GLT1, the most abundant of the known high‐affinity glutamate transporters, is found exclusively in astrocytes in adult brain of several species, but we and others have recently identified neurons that transiently express GLT1 protein in the developing brain. We now demonstrate the development of cell type specificity for GLT1 expression at 60, 71, and 136 days' gestation in the developing sheep brain (term = 145 days). At 60 and 71 days of gestation, GLT1 colocalizes with calbindin in Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, and this expression pattern has a novel distribution that is reminiscent of the parasagittal zebrin‐like bands. GLT1 immunoreactivity simultaneously occurs in periventricular white matter, anterior commissure, and striatal white matter, dissipating by 136 days. GLT1 protein expression within astrocytes is developmentally regulated, appearing first in vimentin positive radial glia at 60 and 71 days and then switching to GFAP positive parenchymal and perivascular astrocytes at 136 days. Expression of GLT1 in subsets of vimentin‐positive astrocytes persists in white matter but not in cortex. These results identify a novel compartmentation within cerebellar cortex and neuronal and axonal pathway localization of GLT1, suggesting the participation of this glutamate transporter in the development of the topographic organization of cerebellar cortex and a transient neuronal function for GLT1 in developing brain. In addition, GLT1 expression is highly plastic, being neither exclusively astroglial nor uniformly expressed in different populations of astrocytes during brain development",

        "organization": "Johns Hopkins SOM Professor Pathology &amp; Director Pathobiology Graduate Program",
        "abstract": "It is unknown whether DNA damage accumulation is an upstream instigator or secondary effect of the cell death process in different populations of adult postmitotic neurons in the central nervous system. In two different mouse models of injury-induced neurodegeneration characterized by relatively synchronous accumulation of mitochondria, oxidative stress, and DNA damage prior to neuronal apoptosis, we enforced the expression of human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) and human apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease-1/Ref1 (hAPE) using recombinant adenoviruses (Ad). Thalamic lateral geniculate neurons and lumbar spinal cord motor neurons were transduced by Ad-hOGG1 and Ad-hAPE injections into the occipital cortex and skeletal muscle, respectively, prior to their target deprivation- and axotomy-induced retrograde apoptosis. Enforced expression of hOGG1 and hAPE in thalamus and spinal cord was confirmed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. In injured populations of neurons in thalamus and spinal cord, a DNA damage response (DDR) was registered, as shown by localization of phospho-activated p53, Rad17, and replication protein A-32 immunoreactivities, and this DDR was attenuated more effectively by enforced hAPE expression than by hOGG1 expression. Enforced expression of hOGG1 and hAPE significantly protected thalamic neurons and motor neurons from retrograde apoptosis induced by target deprivation and axotomy. We conclude that a DDR response is engaged pre-apoptotically in different types of injured mature CNS neurons and that DNA repair enzymes can regulate the survival of retrogradely dying neurons, suggesting that DNA damage and activation of DDR are upstream mechanisms for this form of adult neurodegeneration in vivo, thus identifying DNA repair as a therapeutic target for neuroprotection.",
