        "abstract": "In today's world, there is a growing need for surveillance in order to maintain the decorum at a place and ensure the safety and security of its people. An aerial surveillance system will be worthwhile in this regard. This paper describes how an aerial surveillance system can be built using an unmanned aerial vehicle or a drone. We start by delineating the features of our aerial surveillance system and then discuss some of the technologies that we have used in building it. After that we mention how we have incorporated those technologies into a drone and have made them work together harmoniously in order to achieve our desired aerial surveillance system. This system will be a convenient and efficient alternative to current surveillance systems. It can be used in peace keeping activities and also real time monitoring of a place at any time of the day. The aim is to provide fast and efficient surveillance at an affordable rate so that it can be used widely at private, institutional and governmental level.",

        "abstract": "GPS is an omnipresent technology for traffic analysis. The flip side; however in GPS is that it is not completely real time & it only deals with highways, freeways, sometimes main streets in large cities. Jamdroid is a real time, collaborative road traffic information system that aims to remedy these shortcomings of GPS. Jamdroid is a totally new concept, one which can hopefully replace or augment GPS in the near future. Hence for a system processing such large amount of data, provisions must be made for effective live stream handling. Data Stream Management Systems offers one such novel way of stream handling. We will see how such a system can gain immensely by incorporating Data Stream Management System, using open-source TelegraphCQ, for data stream processing & querying.",

        "organization": "Asst. Professor of Computer Engineering Aligarh Muslim University",
        "abstract": "Computer software that can intercept and log traffic passing over a digital network or part of a network is better known as packet sniffer. The sniffer captures these packets by setting the NIC card in the promiscuous mode and eventually decodes them. The decoded information can be used in any way depending upon the intention of the person concerned who decodes the data (i.e. malicious or beneficial purpose). Depending on the network structure one can sniff all or just parts of the traffic from a single machine within the network. However, there are some methods to avoid traffic narrowing by switches to gain access to traffic from other systems on the network. This paper focuses on the basics of packet sniffer and its working, development of the tool on Linux platform and its use for Intrusion Detection. It also discusses ways to detect the presence of such software on the network and to handle them in an efficient way. Focus has also been laid to analyze the bottleneck scenario arising in the network, using this self developed packet sniffer. Before the development of this indigenous software, minute observation has been made on the working behavior of already existing sniffer software such as wireshark (formerly known as ethereal), tcpdump, and snort, which serve as the base for the development of our sniffer software. For the capture of the packets, a library known as libpcap has been used. The development of such software gives a chance to the developer to incorporate the additional features that are not in the existing one",

To get the location coordinates, application is using GPS (Global Positioning System) as location provider. The application design has five parts: a mobile client, a web server, a database, GPS system and a map service. A mobile client which consists of a mobile and GPS receiver finds the location of the user to get aware of his location. In order to share this location the mobile client sends this location to the web server from where other users can get this location if they have the authentication provided by the user. The mobile client is implemented using J2ME which is one of the most promising software platforms for mobile devices. Sun representatives assert that 18 to 20 million mobile phones support the J2ME platform. Analysts predict that within the next few years, this technology will become omnipresent. According to Gartner Group estimates, in 2006, approximately 80 percent of mobile phones will support Java. The web server side programming is done using PHP and database is maintained by MYSQL",

        "abstract": "The use of mobile devices has become a part of our daily routine. Recently, mobile devices like mobile phones or portable digital displays (PDAs) are equipped with global positioning system (GPS) receptors that allow us to get the device's geographic position in real time. Location Based Services (LBS) are regarded as a key feature of many future mobile applications. GPS serves well for most outdoor applications, however, its dependence on satellites makes it ineffective for indoor environments. This document gives a detail on our ongoing project work in the field of Location Based Services for JAVA enabled mobile devices, equipped with GPS receptor. We present a novel technique to send GPS coordinates to other mobiles through Short Message Service (SMS) based on Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. This application also enables the users to get their current location coordinates (latitude, longitude and altitude) and they can also view their locations on the Google maps. Further, this application also enables the user to share his location with their friends through a web server using internet connectivity in their hand helds. GPS is a satellite-based navigation system made up of a network of 24 satellites placed into orbit by the United States (US) Department of Defense (DoD). GPS was originally intended for military applications, but in the 1980s, the government made the system available for civilian use. GPS can show you your exact position on the Earth in any weather conditions, anywhere in the world, 24 hours a day. There are no subscription fees or setup charges to use GPS [6].",

In many applications in the real world, data is not stored at a place (as in conventional DBMS) i.e. in this model, data does not take the form of persistent relations, but rather arrives in multiple, continuous, rapid, time-varying data streams. Almost all traffic analysis tasks too fall under this category as the amount of data flowing are bursts of stream. The huge amount of data that has to be managed and analyzed together with the fact that many different analysis tasks are performed over a small set of different network trace formats, motivates us to study whether data stream management systems (DSMSs) might be useful to develop network traffic analysis tools.",

With the advancement in the technology, the role of the guide is being taken up by the different services and applications. The increase in the use of mobile phones has made it easier to provide different applications available to the tourists `on the go'. In this project, we are making an android based mobile application that can be used as a guide by the tourists. The main function of this application is to recognize a monument or a famous spot from the picture clicked/uploaded by the user and to provide detailed information regarding it. This is achieved by using open-cv for image recognition. It then displays the information that is associated with that monument. The information is available in the JSON database. It will also be able to point the location of that monument on the map.",

        "abstract": "A research on the related technology and implementation of IP phone based on WiFi network is discussed in this paper; it includes the net structure of the technology used in designing the terminal of IP phone. This technology is a form of telecommunication that allows data and voice transmissions to be sent across a wide range of interconnected networks. A WiFi enabled IP phone is used which is preinstalled with the Symbian Operating System and a software application is developed using J2ME which allows free and secured communication between selected IP phones in the WiFi network. This communication is done with the use of routing tables organized in the WiFi routers. Using the free bandwidth of 2.4 GHz communication channels are established. The communication channel being a free bandwidth is vulnerable to external attacks and hacking. Thereby this challenge of creating a secure communication channel is addressed by using two different encryption mechanisms. The payload and header of the voice data packets are encrypted using two different algorithm techniques. Hence the communication system is made almost fully secure. Also the WiFi server can tunnel the calls to the GSM network using UNC. Moreover the creation of a vertical handoff protocol will provide seamless communication for users. This handoff is defined in the context of a diverse network environment. It is cost effective, it allows easier communication, is great for international usages, and it can be very useful for large corporations. In time this will become a cheap and secure way to communicate and will have a large effect on university, business and personal communication.",

        "abstract": "As of now, GPS is an almost ubiquitous technology. However, it is not completely real time & it only deals with highways, freeways, sometimes main streets in large cities. Jamdroid is a real time, collaborative road traffic information system that aims to remedy these shortcomings of GPS. Jamdroid is a new collaborative project that gathers road traffic reports from all its end-users, compiles the data and reports back to the navigation software of the users. It involves a data analysis algorithm running on the user device, and Internet servers that retrieve the data from the user, merge them, and send them back to the community. We know that it might not be possible to equip every vehicle with a GPS receiver. Hence to maximize available traffic data, we explore the option of introducing RFID tag for gathering GPS data. Such a system is meant to be accessed by a large number of users, and has to be fast & responsive enough to deal with all the requests; hence, provisions must be made for effective live stream handling. We will see how such a system can gain immensely by incorporating Data Stream Management System, using open-source TelegraphCQ, for data stream processing & querying.",

        "abstract": "SGSN and GGSN are the two core network elements of the general packet radio service which enables Internet to become mobile. It allows mobile users to access text based data services without continuously occupying a specific radio channel (which is not the case when you access voice channel). This paper successfully discusses the possibility of exploiting the data communication features of GGSN/SGSN to transmit voice packets, using a web server. This can help GPRS grow beyond its capability. As the data channel is considered to be economically viable in any network, If a mechanism is devised to use mobile's data channel for voice communication too, it will obviously be preferred over the conventional non-mobile based VOIP service. Because of the fact that general packet radio service through the GGSN/SGSN element can transfer data at the rate of 56 to 114 kbps (For EDGE it is 177.6 kbps) and has a continuous connection to internet via the core network elements, so if the voice at one end be broken into data packets and transmitted through a web server, can be reassembled at the other end. This process wont make a big hole in the customer's pocket and can easily make the VOIP go mobile, using the same network elements. While the traditional circuit switched network makes a quite bigger hole if the call is a long distance.",

A large number of cryptographic techniques are available to handle this problem. To increase data security, data can first be compressed using compression techniques and then encryption techniques can be applied. In this paper, we are proposing two new algorithms for encryption in which we have incorporated the concept of diffusion and confusion. The algorithms are based on Transposition cipher, Substitution cipher and Symmetric Key Encryption. Brute force on these algorithms can't be done so easily.

        "abstract": "The paper presents a new approach for Bandwidth control in Broadband Access Networks, especially Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) and Cable Internet (DOCSIS) users. The basic idea is to have a broadband line to the server receiving all the incoming bandwidth. The approach is to have bandwidth division among various VLANs in a network connected via a switch to a centralized server. This approach can be implemented either in an institution where the amount of bandwidth to each department falling under one VLAN can be allocated proportional to the usage and requirements or in an industry where bandwidth needs to be allocated to various divisions. The concept of giving bandwidth according to the VLAN has been made to enhance security and ensuring that the traffic of one VLAN reaches that particular VLAN only. The basic idea is to have a broadband line to the server receiving all the incoming bandwidth. The server then queue the packets according to the VLAN id. The VLAN id of some department having paid for higher bandwidth or having more importance will be given higher priority at the server. All packets belonging to a particular VLAN will be queued in the same queue. The VLAN having higher precedence will have more of its packets sent than the other queues to ensure that the VLAN which was allocated higher bandwidth will receive that bandwidth. The idea is to have VLANs spread across multiple switch yet providing the proportionate bandwidth to each VLAN and also provide mobility to each member of VLAN. Some end users who are of interdisciplinary departments will be members of two or more VLANs.",

        "abstract": "In this age of significant telecommunications competition, mobile network operators continuously seek new and innovative ways to create differentiation and increase profits. One of the best ways to accomplish this is through the delivery of highly personalized services. One of the most powerful ways to personalize mobile services is based on location. Location is a key to provide location based services (LBS) to the user because the location information is typically useful for coverage, deployment, routing, location service, target tracking and rescue operations. One of the most obvious technologies behind LBS is positioning, with the most widely recognized system being the Global Positioning System (GPS). There are no subscription fees or setup charges to use GPS. This document provides detail on the design and implementation of a java application which provides the users current location sends this location using SMS (Short Message Service) plus sharing location with friends and family and views them on maps. Users can also take benefit of this application in emergency situations by using emergency feature of this application. To get the location coordinates, application is using GPS (Global Positioning System) as location provider. The application design has five parts: a mobile client, a web server, a database, GPS system and a map service. A mobile client application which consists of a mobile and GPS receiver finds the location of the user to get aware of his location. In order to share this location the mobile client sends this location to the web server from where other users can get this location if they have the authentication provided by the user. The mobile client is implemented using J2ME which is one of the most promising software platforms for mobile devices. Sun representatives assert that 18 to 20 million mobile phones support the J2ME platform. Analysts predict that within the next few years, this technology will become omnipresent. The web server side programming is done using PHP and database is maintained by MYSQL.",

As 3GPP IMS standards are in their embryonic state it becomes very crucial to test IMS clients during their development on a platform that simulates the IMS network. IMS client testbed also allows the developers to experiment all error circumstances which are not possible on a live network. Furthermore, it is also very costly to use an operator's live network for testing purpose.

        "organization": "Asst. Professor of Computer Engineering Aligarh Muslim University",
        "abstract": "With the expanding usage of mobile handsets for different types of communications, traditional landline service is being discarded in increasing numbers. But, the main hurdle in the mobile handset evolution is that when a user is inside a building there is degradation in the reception of signals. Femtocells have emerged out as a key solution to this problem. Femtocells are low power, indoor base-stations similar to Wi-Fi access points. They connect users with cellular providers via customersâ broadband Internet links, not via telephony infrastructure, thereby eliminating indoor reception problems. Femtocells extend carriersâ wireless networks directly into the homes. With this extension comes the challenge of integrating millions of wireless base stations with the existing mobile infrastructure. There are many different ways of achieving this integration. Among those, IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) based integration method can act as a major option. The purpose of this paper is to identify the issues surrounding this new technology, highlight the major challenges in the deployment of femtocells, give some preliminary ideas to overcome them and to bring forward the major reasons which strengthen the IMS candidature.",

Recent evolutions in the technology have made it possible to deliver digital television services over fixed and mobile broadband network, which is commonly known as IPTV. IPTV is a system in which digital television services are provided using internet protocol over a network. The deployment of Internet Protocol-based television (IPTV) over different broadband access networks is made possible by the new types of broadband access networks and improved media coding algorithms. Many service providers have started to deploy triple play services over DSL including IPTV as an essential service component. However, each service in the triple play bundle (e.g. IPTV, VoIP) has its own unique service-control framework and operations and billing support systems, increasing the complexity of the overall triple play service architecture therefore, there is a need of flexible network architecture. In this paper we discuss about the features of IPTV along with the integration of IMS and IPTV service platforms to reduce network complexity and provide a flexible network for new services.",

The technique basically involves making queues for all the packets and then, to guarantee proper (allocated) bandwidth, transmitting the packets after suitable delay. In short, we have designed a module to be used in a network with centralized control of bandwidth which provides services like limiting data transfer rate, service based priority, and other related services.",

        "title": "IPTV Service over IP Multimedia Subsystem",
        "organization": "Asst. Professor of Computer Engineering Aligarh Muslim University",
        "abstract": "IP Multimedia services provide a dynamic combination of voice, video, messaging, data, etc. within the same session. By increasing the number of basic applications and the media that it is possible to combine, it is possible to increase the number of services offered to the end users, and thus to enrich the interpersonal communication experience. IPTV is a system used to deliver digital television services to the consumers through broadband. This delivery of digital television is made possible by using Internet Protocol over a broadband connection, usually in a managed network rather than the public Internet to preserve quality of service guarantees. The Internet Protocol (IP) Multimedia Subsystem, better known as \"The IMS\", is based on the specification of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) as standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The IMS is an architecture for the convergence of data, speech and mobile networks and is based on a wide range of protocols, of which most have been developed by the IETF. It combines and enhances them to allow real time services on top of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) packet-switched domain. This paper presents what IPTV is, its requirements, how IPTV will be merged with IMS and various standardization efforts for IPTV. It further also deals the advantage of IMS based IPTV, its implementation challenges, performance and capacity, and testing requirement.",

        "abstract": "There is a rapid growth and evolution in the area of telecommunications and network operators are expected to provide seamless integration of all communication applications on a single system. In these circumstances IMS has emerged out as a key player. IMS is basically a network architecture consisting of an IP-based core network connected to multiple access networks to provide a converged service to wireless,wireline and cable subscribers. IMS has established itself as a foundation for future wireless and wireline convergence. It provides an opportunity to build an open IP based service platform that will enable an easy and efficient deployment of new multimedia communication services mixing telecom and data services. One thing which really makes a difference is that a common IMS based service platform can be used to serve various access mechanisms such as WiMAX, WiFi, UMTS,GSM, CDMA etc. IMS fills the gap between two of the most successful communication paradigm cellular and internet technology. This paper surveys the IMS network architecture and how its various components interact with each other.",

        "abstract": "The most common method of authentication or protection against intrusion in a computer system is to use alphanumeric usernames and password. Choosing a strong password and protecting the chosen password has always been a popular topic among security researchers. Traditionally strong password schemes could provide with certain degree of security but strong password leads complexity and difficult to memorize and often leads their owner to write them down on paper. As a result, security becomes compromised. Also a good password is one which can be typed quickly, so someone else can't look over your shoulder. In this paper we explore some techniques of protecting the passwords and try to eliminate the shouldering problem. We also try to eliminate the dictionary attacks and brute-force attacks. Later on we tried to evolve a password scheme with some graphic technique which can be used in highly secured applications.",

Internet radio involves streaming media, presenting listeners with a continuous stream of audio that cannot be paused or replayed, much like traditional broadcast media; in this respect, it is distinct from on-demand file serving. Internet radio is also distinct from pod casting, which involves downloading rather than streaming. Many Internet radio services are associated with a corresponding traditional (terrestrial) radio station or radio network. Internet-only radio stations are independent of such associations.

The idea carries three main concepts called connection establishment with user defined performance parameters, back pressure re-routing and error resiliency by feedback control. The performance parameters we consider here are time delay and bandwidth. Establishing a connection that gives user a guaranteed performance is achieved by making tests at the intermediate nodes while making a virtual circuit to ensure that the nodes are capable of giving required performance. The backpressure re-routing will take care of making new paths for the video packets when any of the nodes in existing path is no more able to perform with required parameters values. Finally the two-way communication over the same channel is used for the feedback based error control to effectively maintain the visual quality at the receiving end.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a technique to improve anti-theft for android based mobile phones by using different services like MMS instead of SMS. As the use of smartphones, tablets, phablets based on android operating system is increasing, many scenarios related with anti-theft have already been proposed and many software based on anti-theft have also been developed, but most of these software are not freely available and it's difficult to identify the thief by using these software's e.g. GPS Tracking. We put forward a new scheme, which enhances the present scenario, based on new technologies like Multimedia Messages. The scenario proposed in this work is totally dependent on the hardware of your smartphone like camera (front & back) and support for multimedia messages. Once this software is installed, it will work in the background, stores the current SIM number in a variable and keeps checking continuously for SIM change, whenever SIM gets changed from mobile, it will take snapshots and record a video in the background i.e., without taking user permission and then it will send an MMS, and number of snap shots, to an alternate mobile number and an email id, which was provided during installation. The enviable advantage of this software is that it is very easy to configure and it keeps running in the background without interrupting the user. To some extent it helps the owner to identify the thief.",

This device has evolved out of the research that despite of large deployment of macrocell (BTS/BSC) in high density apartment areas and densely populated urban population, the signal strength and voice quality is a major challenge to achieve. But on the other side of the coin there are potential handoff challenges in the implementation of femtocells because of the limitations in the number of adjacent cell sites and unavailability of adequate neighboring cell information during mobility. This paper focuses on the overview of femtocell technology, its potential implementation challenges, Interference evaluation, traditional handoff technique and the suggestion to adopt mobile station (MS) controlled handoff technique that should be adopted in order to successfully handover the control from the mobile operator cell (macrocell) to the femtocell and vice versa.",

The gateway is used to route VoIP calls on to the PSTN network (GSM as well as landline) and vice-versa. 4-port FXO/FXS card is used for implementing PSTN gateway while a Bluetooth enabled mobile phone compatible with asterisk server is used to implement the GSM gateway. This model will drastically reduce the overall cost of communication.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an overview of random early detection algorithm and differentiated services on ns2. In the present scenario of computer networks the traffic is increasing exponentially due to which packet losses are also increasing at a great rate. An active queue management in routers and gateways can potentially reduce packet loss rates in the Internet. In this paper we have proposed use of an active queue management algorithm, a modified form of RED algorithm, called MRED (Multi RED) which is an effective way to reduce packet loss rates in the internet. MRED computes the packet drop probability based on our heuristic method rather than the simple method used in RED and enables bandwidth allocation over a single link to different types of traffics. Using simulation, MRED can be shown to perform better than existing queue management schemes. This paper also introduces implementation of DiffServ (differentiated service) and MRED on ns2 simulator thus depicting advantages of QoS (quality of service) to improve network congestion.",

        "abstract": "With the help of software such as packet sniffer one can easily intercept or capture the network packets that travel across the network. The sniffer captures these packets by setting the NIC card in the promiscuous mode and eventually decodes them and they can be used for several fruitful purposes. This paper discusses the different steps for the development of packet sniffer using Linux as a platform. This paper presents a novel approach to the development of a packet sniffer, one which we have employed and added features for packet analysis and intrusion detection. It also lists different steps that can be taken to encounter the malicious use of packet sniffers (e.g. ARP sniffing, SNMP monitoring etc.). Packet sniffer developed by us can be used for network monitoring to prevent bottlenecks when network congestion occurs. The development phase began after studying the behavior of already existing sniffer softwares such as Wire Shark or Ethereal on both Linux and Windows platform. In the development of the packet sniffer a library known as libpcap is used, which is an in built feature of an OS and help us to grab the packets directly from the network card.",

        "abstract": "Location Based Service (LBS) refers to class of applications that provides services based on the current or a known location. The location information can be obtained through the mobile communication network or the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) [8]. But in all the cases after extracting information we have to make an exhaustive processing over this extracted geographic information. And this exhaustive processing requires a significant amount of time if it is performed by traditional techniques. Artificial Intelligence, on the other hand, has been proven to be useful in the interpretation of spatial resource information. On of the artificial intelligence technique to support spatial processing is artificial neural networks (ANNs). The recent developments in ANN technology have made it more ofan applied mathematical technique that has some similarities to the human brain. The integration of LBS with AIoffers a potential mechanismto lower the analysis-time of spatial information. One major advantage is that this integration allows the interpretive result from a small area to be transferred to a larger, geographically similar area. The objective of this paper is to discuss about the relativity of LBS services and Artificial Intelligence technologies and to uncover the benefits of converging LBS and AI.",

A truly seamless mobile environment can only be realized by considering vertical and horizontal handoffs together. One of the major design issues in heterogeneous wireless networks is the support of vertical handoff. Vertical handoff occurs when a user with a multi-interface terminal changes association from one type of wireless access technology to another while maintaining an active session. It is believed that vertical handoff decision will be based on multiple criteria. In this paper review of Vertical Handoff Mechanisms (VHM), decision models and IEEE standard 802.21 (also called Media Independent Handover) have been discussed for seamless vertical handover.",

In contact less payment through mobile device, user is able to pay using his mobile device without touching or swiping card on a reading device. In this paper, we present an idea to equip mobile devices with RFID-enabled SIM (subscriber identity module) card to carry out money transfer. RFID-enabled SIM is a special SIM card that includes RFID (radio frequency identification) chip in the SIM casing. We propose an architecture to integrate RFID and normal SIM features into a single specialized RFID-enabled SIM. This specialized SIM can be used for normal phone applications as well as contact less payment. RFID enables the mobile user to be identified by the RFID reader and SIM stores the payment information. We discuss various scenarios in which RFID-enabled SIM can be used for different applications.
